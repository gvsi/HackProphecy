We wanted to provide rich functionality for Program, Project and Release managers and teams that will allow them to design and use any processes that control the execution of their initiatives, similar to what JIRA provides for individual issues. What it does Lifecycle The center of the universe for Cycle Control is the Release. Users can define Release life-cycle using: series of stages quality gates that control the transition from stage to state milestones checklists Scope and Roll-up The release scope or content can be defined in a bottom-up fashion to be any combination of multiple JIRA projects, versions, components, JIRA Agile boards, Epics or sprints. Cycle control will automatically roll-up all data from these containers. Metrics For each release users can define their own custom metrics, which can: be defined using JIRA Query Language (JQL) use issue count and numeric aggregations, for example: Total Open Bugs, Unestimated Issues, Total Backlog Estimate, Release Burn-down, etc show historic trends provide in-depth analysis of changes between two dates Release Calendars Releases are visualized on beautiful interactive Calendars. Users can create multiple calendars and choose any number of releases. Release Types Release types act as templates and drive consistency across the organization. How I built it The visualization top layer is pure Javascript using AUI components, VisJS and backbone.js. The middle layer containing the business logic is written in Java and uses technologies like EMF for modeling. The bottom layer provides bi-directional synchronization with native JIRA objects such as workflows, issue-types, schemes and issues. Challenges I ran into The main areas of innovation were related to the native synchronization with JIRA objects. A lot of the configuration is created on the fly - workflows, issue types, etc. Accomplishments that I\u0027m proud of We think our Metrics module is one of the best in the JIRA eco-system. The native synchronization works like a charm and allows us to provide superb user experience while enabling users to access and report on native JIRA issues. What\u0027s next for Cycle Control We are actively working on integrating Risk factors and Trends. Dependencies and integration between Releases is the next big module.

I wanted a MMO airplane simulator on a historical context. I began a company and I tried to get funding for the project launching a kickstarter campaign which you can see at www.dogfightelite.com . We were not able to get the target funding and members of the team moved on with their lives (food! Devs also need food!) And everything was cancelled. But as many developers will know, you won’t stop something for lack of funding when it is something you just love to do! I recently found out about this challenge and I decided to give it a try all by myself. Dogfight Elite VR will be a new project just for this contest. Controls - You need a game pad to play. Use the gaze to move and touch through the menus but the gamepad to fly the airplanes, drive the tank or walk around with the soldier. The Gear VR back button will also bring up the menus for the game. Don\u0027t mix gamepad/gaze controls because the system won\u0027t know if you are selecting the button with the gamepad or the one you are gazing at. In short: menus \u003d gaze. airplane \u003d gamepad. Mechanics- You have practice missions to get yourself trained for multiplayer. The fun part is on multiplayer, there you have multiple missions that are picked randomly. You will be able to fly World War I airplanes (german and allied side), buy a parachute and a tank and then use them when they bring you down. Missions include: Capture the flag, destroy the zeppelin, bring down the aircraft carrier, destroy the enemy base and so on. Innovation- Well, you feel like you are actually inside a World War I airplane! When you drop a bomb or when an enemy gets in your six, you just need to look at your back to see where he is going. You can just look around to get a quick feeling of what\u0027s going on! The menus popup in 3d in front of you. When you are brought down and you jump into the parachute, it\u0027s very cool. You pass from sitting inside your airplane to suddenly in mid-air attached to a chute! Praying the enemy airplane won\u0027t aim at you so you can land safely. I\u0027m getting into the contest so I can get funding to continue developing and improving the game. No matter what, I will always continue working on this project. If I were lucky enough to get funding I would definitely focus on bringing the team back together and keep evolving the game. Thanks to everyone for your input and type away on the comments section!

Enter into his painting to find out.","description":"The Night Cafe is an immersive VR environment that allows you to explore the world of Vincent van Gogh first hand. Take a moment to enjoy his iconic sunflowers in 3 dimensions or walk around the chair he painted in his bedroom to see it from another angle. Step into the vivid colors straight from his palette. Controls: I wanted something very simple and intuitive so I went with a minimalist control scheme with just tap to move forward and swipe up or down to crouch or stand. I experimented with touchpad rotation but it seemed to take away from the immersion factor because you no longer had to actually turn your head to look around. I also wanted to keep some kind of height change ability with crouching because it enables the visitor to get different vantage points -- one example is when you crouch down near the window to get a better view of the swirling stars. Mechanics: Because this is an environmental experience and not a game there are no \"mechanics\" so to speak. Just wander around at your leisure and enjoy :) Innovation: My main goal with this project was to see what kinds of stylized 3D rendering could be experienced through VR. I have always been drawn to the paintings of Van Gogh and I imagined it would be amazing to be inside one of these colorful worlds. While the GearVR offered certain challenges with its technical limitations compared with a PC, it forced me to prioritize and really define what makes a Van Gogh painting unique. While creating the environments of these paintings in 3D space I\u0027ve had to expand on areas that can\u0027t be seen; rooms behind doors, objects hidden from view, people turned away from the viewer. It\u0027s been an interesting process in using reference material from Van Gogh and other expressionist painters but also imagining what might have been there, just off the edges of the canvas.

This is why we built a smart clock tool that allows developers to clock time and then save as worklog entry. The entry including hours and comments get automatically transferred to Cronforce. What Cronforce Time Tracking for Jira does Cronforce includes features such as: Track time from issues in JIRA Save automatically in Cronforce Project and task selections are pre-populated once chosen. Entries are populated with the issue ID and title. Worklogs are automatically created How I built it It took us quite a lot of time because we already have an integration with Jira that connects from Cronforce to Jira and pulls all booked times. Now we had to implement the opposite plus ensure both integration work smoothly with each other as well as make the addon smarter and user friendly e.g. pre-select project to track etc. Challenges I ran into We did not run into particular challenges but we enjoyed the process very much and learned a ton about the inner workings of Atlassian products and Jira in particular.

{"likes":97,"hackathon":"USDA Innovation Challenge","winner":false,"name":"PowAgri","blurp":"Your Dream Farming is Now in Your Power Hand","description":"Inspiration Couples of years ago we tried to develop a project which helps a farmer to choose appropriate crop to improve the crop production as well as the income. But due to the scarcity of data we could not able to develop that app. During that time we survey and talked with some our relatives who are directly and closely related to the farming. We observed that farmers choose a crop to harvest based on the previous couple of years crop production, harvesting cost and price. They choose a crop usually based on information available from the agriculture officer, the memorized data or information collects from their neighborhood peoples. Agriculture officer usually advice farmers based on some text based data. But retrieve useful information from the memorized data or a text based data cannot help a farmer to visualize meaningful information. Also these data set has limited data which is unable to effectively help any decision making process. USDA has several data set which has a lot of agriculture related data. By leveraging these data we can help farmers in choosing and comparing several corps. In PowAgri we leverage the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) to help the farmers to choose the most productive and valuable crops by visualizing data in the most intuitive way. The main target user of PowAgri are the farmers, so they want to use any tools which can help farmers in the easiest way. We can visualize information by choosing many attributes, but this is not a practical way for a farmers. Keeping this issues in minds we design our app PowAgri which is an easy to use tools to help farmers in their decision making process. Just a single tap farmers can visualize the information and can make appropriate decision using these data. App Intro Farming is the greenest business. Like any other business, in agriculture farm, farmer keep a log of their crops or products productivity like how much they produce, price or harvested area. Keeping this farm logs or data will be worthy, if they can get meaningful information to improve their farm production. USDA also maintains several dataset to keep the agriculture related data. Except the researcher or a text based data is not very meaningful to farmer, because retrieving meaningful information or analysis is very troublesome for a farmer from these dataset. To resolve these issues, we develop a very easy to use app “PowAgri” to provide a meaningful insight to both the farmer and the researcher so that they can visualize all the data in a meaningful way. Key Features: PowAgri is very easy to use tools for every farmers and researcher to select best crops or compare crops in several attributes. Just a single tap PowAgri visualize data to farmers for helping the decision making process. PowAgri helps farmers to choose appropriate crops for a particular state based on some farming characteristic like yield, price received, area harvested or area planted. Farmers can get insight about which crops is the most productive in their surrounding areas. Compare crop tools helps farmers and researchers to know which crops harvest better than the other crops in terms of yield, production, price, expense and other several attributes. Price analysis tools helps farmers to know the market price of a particular crop in a particular state PowAgri provide the expense information to the farmers for a particular states. Overall PowAgri leverage the USDA NASS data set to help farmers in their decision making process. How It Works Challenges I ran into Three years ago we tried to develop an app like PowAgri. But in that time we did not have enough information, as a result we could not complete our project. On the other hand, after seeing a lot of data in USDA datasets we faced a sweet problem: how to visualize the data to farmers for helping in their decision making process. There are several ways we can visualize data by choosing desired options. But it is not very easy way for a farmer. As our main target user are farmers, we spend a many many hours to design the UX of the apps. We studied a lot of survey, reports and agriculture guidelines to design our app. We also spend a lot of times to determine which information is very important to the farmers so that they can use this information to improve their farming. But at the end we successfully mange and visualize these to the user in the easiest way. Accomplishments that I\u0027m proud of At the very beginning of the PowAgri development process, we were afraid that how to manage these huge dataset and how we can visualize these data to the farmers so that they can use this tool without any headache. We spend hours and hours to simplify the data visualization process. We spend countless hour and design a lot of wireframe to develop an user friendly UX and data visualization. After several mockups wireframe design we are happy that we conclude to a most intuitive and easy to use tools “PowAgri” for every farmers. We developed the app in such modular way that any one can easily add a new analysis module in the project. We opensource the project in the Github. We already published our PowAgri app in the Google play store for the public users. Future of PowAgri We successfully integrate almost all the planned and necessary features in the PowAgri. Despites these features, we have a plan to add an offline caching feature into PopwAgri. This caching feature will help the farmers to cache regularly used analysis in offline mode so that they can use this analysis without internet.

We wanted to amplify the educational benefit by making the user practice his handwriting skills as well as his spelling skills What it does User can choose a language to practice. Ideally, he has some previous knowledge of it, but he lacks in vocabulary and spelling skills. User hears a word being told and should write it down (\"guess it\") A \"guessed word\" means that the user spelled the word that he correctly heard and that the recognition API recognized it as such. As an added bonus, this motivates the user to write more clearly, besides watching his spelling More guessed words lead to a higher level of spelling skill The user is presented with short words to begin with. As he\u0027s leveling up, the words become longer and harder to spell. On the contrary, that doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027re being harder to recognize - MyScript\u0027s CDK has surprised us many times in successfully recognizing long, lousy written words.

With over 5 million users worldwide, almost everyone had access to Lucidchart.... except customers that required onpremises storage of their documents. Enter Lucidchart OnPrem for Confluence Cloud. We built Lucidchart OnPrem to provide our cutting edge technology to customers sitting behind firewalls, and also to offer a Paid-by-Atlassian add-on within the marketplace. Inspiration Over 300+ customers have requested an onpremises add-on from Lucidchart. We built this for them, and for all the others who wanted Lucidchart, but were unable to adopt our cloud-based solution. Why it\u0027s special While we were not able to replicate all of web-based Lucidchart\u0027s functionality (e.g., mobile apps, @mentioning, free integrations, etc.), we still wanted to deliver the premier self-hosted solution for Confluence. Below are a few features that only we are able to offer to customers behind firewalls. Real-time collaboration - multiple editors can diagram together in real-time without overriding each other\u0027s edits, enhancing collaboration. Lucidchart OnPrem is the first self-hosted add-on with real-time collaboration In-editor collaboration - comment on shapes, leave feedback, and record next steps within the diagram Presentation-mode - easily create presentations from diagrams for meetings, or embed as slides in pages Visio import / export - high-fidelity Visio import and export Auto-generate diagrams - automatically generate ERDs and other diagrams from source files, like .schema All of these features come in addition to the standard functionality of creating, editing, and embedding diagrams, charts, and visuals to improve communication in Confluence. Lucidchart also includes extensive templates and shape libraries for network diagrams, flowcharts, UML diagrams, UI mockups, Venn diagrams, org charts and more. How we built it We reimplemented some of the back end code of our cloud app within the Confluence environment and tweaked the front end to work with it. In the process we had to make significant changes to core system concepts like users, collaboration, comments, diagrams, and attachments so that they make sense on this new platform. Since this add-on has to work on instances without any internet access, we had to bundle all the necessary resources (js, css, images, fonts, templates, etc.) inside the add-on instead of loading them on-demand from a CDN. Implementing some of our unique features like real-time collaboration was particularly challenging as this is not a feature implemented for Server-based add-ons, and the approach was new to the add-on ecosystem. Challenges we ran into We ran into several major challenges in taking the functionality of our add-on from the cloud to fully onpremises. Among these were challenges enabling real-time collaboration, using an embedded rich viewer within Confluence to create slide shows, and taking our 100% cloud-based functionality into a format that can be used entirely behind a firewall. What\u0027s next for Lucidchart OnPrem for Confluence Server We are currently taking the lessons we learned from building Lucidchart OnPrem and applying them to our web-based Lucidchart add-on. These changes will make both products faster, more reliable, and more valuable to our end users. Aside from the business push, we also plan to continue iterating and improving upon the add-on based on customer feedback. For instance, we will be releasing a new version with improved revision history controls shortly. Summary Just like taking a Server-based add-on to the Cloud, taking Lucidchart to the Server was challenging and required many large and small changes to our existing product to deliver an excellent solution for our customers. We hope you\u0027ll enjoy testing Lucidchart OnPrem. Feel free to give us your thoughts as we are always working to make our products better, faster, and smarter. Thanks!

{"likes":56,"hackathon":"LA Hacks 2015","winner":true,"name":"Kickback","blurp":"Effortless, fire-and-forget Amazon refunds when prices change","description":"Inspiration Amazon has a policy stating that if a product you buy from them has a lower price within a week of your purchase, you are entitled to a refund of the difference. Unfortunately, many aren\u0027t aware of this policy, and even if they are, it goes unused as it\u0027s a real hassle to do all the required legwork. Kickback is something that people could and should actually use. A few days before LA Hacks, I bought a scooter. Just yesterday, the price dropped $10. Because the application hadn\u0027t yet been built, I had to go through the \"traditional\" process of verifying what I\u0027d paid, checking the new price, finding the dates to see if I was eligible, and finally the tedious task of contacting Amazon. This experience made me realize how needed this product was. Kickback has literally no downsides to the consumer, and offers huge potential upsides. How it Works Users log in through Google in our mobile application (or soon via a webapp), which also serves as a beautiful list of pending and successful refunds. We check your Gmail Inbox for new Amazon orders, and watch for fluctuations in price. If something drops (monitored via Amazon\u0027s Product Advertising API), not only do we recognize that you\u0027re owed a refund, but we also send an email on your behalf (from your account using the Gmail REST API) to Amazon, requesting that the difference be refunded to you. Your only interaction with Kickback will be to sign up once, and then receive push notifications whenever we\u0027ve saved you money. Accomplishments We\u0027re pretty happy to have made a simple way to passively take advantage of a great policy that you may not have known existed. In terms of technical achievements, we were able to build a relatively scalable MVP in a short amount of time; we organized worker execution with simple in-memory schedulers that could probably handle hundreds or thousands of users as is. We also made a really pretty app. What\u0027s next for Kickback This service could be very easily scaled; as more and more people automatically monitor products and get refunds, request overhead goes down due to overlap. The service could stay operational by charging a small percentage of each refund amount, or through donations. We built this on Azure, so it\u0027d be dead simple to scale by switching to an actual Mongo cluster and a standard microservice architecture. In the future, we\u0027d also want to use some of Azure\u0027s built in caching/queueing features to make this a bit more asynchronous; requests are currently done inline because of time constraints. The fact that Azure did basic DNS for us was amazing, huge props for that feature.

Sea turtles are a part of two vital ecosystems: beaches and marine systems. If sea turtles become extinct, both the marine and beach ecosystems will weaken. And since humans use the ocean as an important source for food and beaches for many kinds of activities, weakness in these ecosystems would have harmful effects on humans. Though sea turtles have been living and thriving in the world’s oceans for 150 million years, they are now in danger of extinction largely because of changes brought about by humans. If we alter the oceans and beaches enough to wipe out sea turtles, will those changes make it difficult for us to survive? And if we choose to do what’s necessary to save sea turtles, might we save our own future? (credit : www.bonaireturtles.org ) one of the threats for sea turtles is egg poaching, During the nesting season, hunters comb the beaches looking for nesting females at night . Often, they will wait until the female has deposited her eggs to kill her. Then, they take both the eggs and meat. unfortunately the number of egg poaching are increasing every year, in Sangalaki, a small Island in Indonesia, this case increased by 120% compared to 2013. a local intitute, Yayasan Penyu Laut Indonesia (YPLI) said that almost 1200 egg are stolen by poacher per month in Pasemut Island during a nesting season. Sea turtles have played vital roles in maintaining the health of the world’s oceans for more than 150 million years. These roles range from maintaining productive coral reef ecosystems to transporting essential nutrients from the oceans to beaches and coastal dunes.this case successfully made our heart sink, so we hope this little tool we made can help out to ensuring sustainability of sea turtle\u0027s life. It is the right time for us to protect sea turtles and rebuild their populations to healthy levels as a vital step in ensuring healthy and resilient oceans for the future. The Problem, and The Solution we offer Egg Poaching is one of the major causes of Sea turtle Extinction. Since it happened a lot in Indonesia, then it become our responsibility to stop it. as a Computer Science student, we believe that by creating a Tool and a System that could Initialize and start a Crowd/community based movement to protect Turtle\u0027s egg from poaching can do a little help to prevent Sea Turtle from Extinction. How it works This Penyu Ranger (Sea Turtle Ranger) Project consist of the tool, and an android app. we called the tool as \"Penyusuar\" (inspired from Mercusuar, an Indonesian Language for Lighthouse) made of Raspberry pi, a proper web cam and PIR sensor. this tool was built to help Rangers (a name we gave to those who volunteered as turtle conserver) protect eggs from poacher, it can detect if there are threats around the nest of turtle\u0027s egg. we divided the threats into three conditions, condition one, if there\u0027s predator(animal) around the nest Penyusuar will play a dog-barking sound to drive away the predator. condition two, if there\u0027s human around the nest our tool will define them as a threat or non-threat, if they\u0027re considered as a non-threat our tool will only detect their faces and upload it to our dropbox. and condition three if Penyusuar define the human as a real threat, if they approaching the nest and stay there for a certain distance and amount of time our tool will upload their faces to dropbox (as suspect) and inform all rangers via SMS so rangers can make sure if there\u0027s a real threat and take care of it. The android app made to help rangers in order to manage the Penyusuar (located in each turtle nest) it will record the data of the Penyusuar installment including coordinate of the nest and Penyusuar location(automatically added), date of installment, number of eggs on the nest and the species of the turtle. this app will also give a reminder to the rangers on the 60th day since the installment that the egg is about to hatch, so Rangers can move the eggs to the conservatory and perform a semi-natural hatching. within our app rangers can manage Penyusuar record, show it in a Map, view uploaded photos, and also give rangers a statistical information about the number of threats per day shown on a chart. Challenges we ran into how to help Turtle Conserver against Egg Poaching how to develop a system that can save turtle from extinction. Accomplishments that I\u0027m proud of We can work in pressure, and also in team We can contribute to save turtle from extinction What we learned We learned that in order to save sea ecosystem, we cant miss a single part of it. Sea turtles have played vital roles in maintaining the health of the world’s oceans for more than 150 million years, but now they are in danger of extinction. We need to help them, that\u0027s what we need to in order to ensuring a healthy and resilient oceans for another million years. What\u0027s next for Penyu Ranger Our next dream is to Refine the design of the tools, collaborate with local conservatory organization and apply this solution in real-life.

How I built it we built the app using Google app engine PHP we created rest API for the back end and ember.js in the front end, with the power of google infrastructure the application is salable and reliable. Challenges I ran into well the main challenge was to make the app handy and to the point so it can solve the real problem, so we had to check multiple apps and come up with this imagination of how the email and note can be in the same place, deploying a zend application over a google application engine wasn\u0027t easy enough we ran into lots problems because Google has some rules that was violated by most of the php frameworks, so we had to make sure that the framework will run smoothly Accomplishments that I\u0027m proud of we are proud that we made a tool that will erase our daily pain. and from the technical side we are proud that we could combine the powers of Zend framework , Google App Engine and Ember.js together.

We create crowdsourced routes, to build reliable on-demand transportation.","description":"Inspiration A year Ago in August 2014 I decided to join Mexico city and its entrepreneurial environment. Working in an innovation technology center (CTIN) and spending the rest of my day in communities for programmers and hackers (as DEV.F). trying to figure out a pain that most of people suffer and it’s funny because being in this city for 6 months is easy to think as normal spending 2 to 3 hours in transportation for join the office if you use a car, near to 1.5 to 2 hours in public transportation that is not comfortable, secure or even safe. That’s when I realize the pain I was looking for was there “A lack of quality in public transportation service over Latin America (not just Mexico)”. Transportation should be easy, affordable, comfortable, trustworthy, safe and customer first. That’s how the whole idea of combining on demand routes with Van sharing comes up. What it does Bussi is a transportation network that gives the possibility to transport groups in a Van, linking people with same routes. we make dynamic routes based on traffic behavior and people destination. Through a platform that gives unique user experience to people who wants to move between hard dense urban points to jobs and principal places in main cities with a mobile app. Our goal is to give an affordable cost service atmosphere with help crowdsourcing and on demand service. How I built it First we create a website where people share where they want to go, which days and what time. Then we make a city heat map and start to propose where the route should exist, the most voted route is the one officially opened. Finally the route is integrated to a very simple mobile application where users can see the Van in turn, check schedule and reserve a seat. Challenges I ran into There are so many challenges in starting a product, first and one of the most importants is Team. Bussi needs the right team right now we are a small group in deliver what people wants. we are probably not complete yet but we are still working on it. Second thing is convincing Van owners to try Bussi model, is a hard task we are accomplishing step by step, also we need to have user demand and making growth so both Van owners and users might be satisfied. This is probably a very common challenge in two sided markets. Third is cultural shock, most of people in cities like mexico city are custom to own a car but carpooling or van sharing is something they don’t understand at first, as well people thinks spending 2 to 3 hours in transportations services that lacks quality and safety. So comming with a solution that changes the game in order to penetrate these markets takes a while. Accomplishments that I\u0027m proud of Since very beginning Bussi has been well accepted for must of people, which make us strongly believe we are in the right path to something interesting. Also we have been present in important events like web summit 2014 in dublin. Back in Mexico we have been part of Posible 2015 an event for entrepreneurs where we also provide a transportation service for more than 150 people. And currently we are working with dev.f in Mexico city to transport around 120 group of people. And now we have more than 450 active users in the last 3 months. What I learned Transportation and customer service needs a change in Mexico and Latam. The key for us is traveling with our customers, see what they care for and keep going with what is important. everything else is a distraction. for very specific points, safety and economy is what most of our users care more. Also in case of b2b model, the way to organize events to move big groups of people is what matters. What\u0027s next for Bussi We are currently serving users with a couple of routes, with a very small mvp. To scale is necessary to improve our application, the way people join and ask for a route which also means to have more Van owners and reduce cost.

This resulted in food wastage, or unsatisfied house mates when you don\u0027t cook enough or cook something that they would prefer. This is a problem which all housewives, party/event organizers, and even overseas students staying with housemates (like me) always face! What it does This app solves all the mentioned problems. All you have to do is follow these simple steps: Log in to Sahara using your Facebook account Choose from a set of recommended recipes, which is based on your current ingredient list. Ingredients closer to expiration will have priority. Include the chosen recipe into a meal plan - set a time for the meal and send a message to your house mates through Facebook Check the RSVP list for your meal plan at the end of the day, and have an EASY time cooking your next meal!

We exceeded the limit for one of them, and are forced to find alternatives. Time. If we had more time, we would have implemented a lot more features and make Sahara more awesome than it is now. Trying to integrate our app into mobile. There are a lot of features that do not work even in mobile browsers, such as opening up Facebook dialog and etc technical issues. Accomplishments that the team are proud of That we built a pretty prototype for Sahara. We learnt a lot about Meteor, and probably will not go back to using other web development tools again (LOL) We used the app to plan for our meals today and tomorrow. Our app has proven to be really useful! What I learned Meteor.js development is made much easier with the iron:router package. And other packages that exist to ease development on both front-end and back (i.e. Semantics:UI, webtempest:animate, and many others). Do not judge packages by its install rates. Just try everything that fits your needs. Set up stubs for both front-end and back-end development. To standardise template names, one person should set up the iron:router page routes as soon as possible. What\u0027s next for Sahara We will continue developing it.

Using a combination of x-ray specs, scrutiny and flame thrower, you must assess the party goers quickly to make sure nobody is entering with restricted items. Oh and keep an eye open for people trying to sneak in behind you – some people will do anything to get to the party! Controls The world is interacted with by using collisions and timed responses so that the player is free to play without the need of a controller. Most interactions are achieved with head movement. We have also uitilised the controls on the side of the Gear VR so that the player can turn their x-ray specs on and off with a simple tap. For a secret bonus we have added a space-bar function to change the randomised character generation and while not integral to the game play we found it fun! Mechanics You must use the xray specs (and your own eyes) to look for weapons, drinks and other threats and then must decide whether to let the party guest enter, or give them the boot. Be careful! Get it wrong too often and not only will the party be a disaster, but you will be fired too! On top of this, you must keep an eye open for people trying to sneak in behind them. Looking in the direction of a guilty suspect will activate your weapon mode, allowing you to teach the sneak a lesson. Innovation We strongly believe that the best VR games are created with the hardware fully in mind from the word go. For this reason we have designed an experience that does not relying on character motion, removing any risk of motion sickness. We have created a game that does not rely on any external controls allowing the player to become fully immersed. We also believe that that the “tap for x-ray” control is just the kind of thing that the gear VR was made for. This is designed to make the player feel even further immersed because the sensation of wearing a headset is justified within the game. Working with many characters and very low draw calls is always going to be a challenge, so we opted for a stylised game with randomly generated assets and facial sprites to create hundreds of mad combinations for our party guests. What\u0027s next for us? With more time we would have liked to expand this game to multiple levels, taking the player to new mad landscapes. We had to strip back our idea for the time frame available but future iterations will include more crazy main characters, more randomisation and an upgradable robot body.

Therefore the right people, place, resource and process makes it all worthwhile. As true as that may be, it does not change the fact that the idea itself is very key. Our idea is to change the world for the better. The questions of ‘how” and attitude of “what can be done that has not been” comes up. The world today maybe large in mass or space but still is referred to as a global village because of the barriers that communication has broken. However, global village or not, it will take a lot to make any material change at all, let alone a positive one. But then, all u need is a drop of water on the still surfaced water to get ripples that will span as far as possible. Therefore, a little idea is really all that is needed. In view of the current challenges of insecurity in the world today and the various complications and intricacies involved in challenging the problems. We thought its time to pay attention to the little details. The unrest in most parts of the world today started as mere verbal confrontations ignored or not attended to on time or properly for many reasons therefore degenerating to a state where arms are carried to communicate simple ideas or grievances that would have been ironed out by dialogue and in some cases a simple apology. It is note worthy however that people are often times than not caught in d act of ignoring he needful in resolving disagreements for personal gains. And it is owed sometimes to the absence of a means to communicate both to the other party or the intermediary ( in many cases the police) the lack of knowledge of “how to” and “whom to” is what we are most interested in and are therefore resolve in solving.. It is also important to note the role of media in all of this. The media being the mouthpiece of the people, its importance cannot be over stated. Unfortunately even the media has been caught in the webs of bad politics and all sorts of social decadence making it lose its important role to the value of “dollar faces”. This project seeks to take back this lost glory, and power and put it back in the hands of the ordinary man. The world as we know it today with over 7 billion people, and the majority of that amount being between the ages of 13years to 49years of age, a significant group that cannot be ignored and therefore our target users. With a reasonable amount of this age group having access to the web or/and phones, it is ideal that effecting a change targeted at this group would be most effective to achieving the goal of change. Not to dabble too much into the implications of war or disagreements in the world, but the common knowledge that the progressive economies of the world are all interdependent, it therefore means the problem of a neighbor can easily become yours. I have decided to tackle this ugly phenomenon from its roots. A project that will enable you assess the right authorities with minimum struggle or strain in good time. This venture attempts to cogently address the three primary Base of Pyramid issues of Availability, Accessibility, and Affordability. What exactly does this spell out in the bigger picture? A group of individual in a community(a) move to another community(b) to wreck havoc, which they successfully carry out. However the people most hit in the community (b) complained to their leaders and a reluctant inquiry is made, and of course followed by denials and eventually sweeping the matter under the rug. Charmed by the success of their escapades, they decide to repeat the action but on a slightly bigger scale. This time the people hit are not as calm as the previous, reprisals take place on the community (a), on innocent individuals without knowledge of the wrong committed. It becomes a question then of who should apologize as all parties gear up to retaliate as it were. These communities happen to be on a vast area of land sitting on a large deposit of oil(crude). The host country of the communities happen to be the world’s biggest supplier of oil(crude). The conflict however escalates and, the crude mining process is stalled. The host nation suffers losses in revenue as well as extra cost for containing the disturbance, and also loses investors. Buying nations are short on the product; the higher demand drives prices up and invariable cost of production as the value money waters down. The effect ripples down to unemployment, child mortality, crime rate e.t.c all receive a boost owing to this unrest. The little illustration may not happen to the letter but is to give an idea of how important it is to communicate. Of course a lot would have been avoided if the matter was given the needed attention before it became an issue. This project seeks therefore to make that communication possible with least effort by providing a means of reporting issues to the appropriate authorities and having evidence and therefore, resolving matters as they arise. On a broader scale however, it will also serves as a platform to exchange views, learn and be educated on important issues Our Solution: Criziz recognizes that the best way of tackling poverty, illiteracy and unemployment is to first get people educated directly or indirectly with access to information, medium to air their views with short stories and with direct access to Authorities. In the bid to make the African populace literate, we recognize that this people are poor and may not have access to the latest technologies; we are therefore bringing innovative, free, interactive and readily-available tools into use. The tool (Mobile Phones) is selected because they are available to a large population of people in Africa than computers. They are cheaper to have for every age group in the society. Conventional means of information dissemination are expensive and hard to set-up. The key feature how ever to me is moving or taking an extra step to systematically help repairing or restoring normalcy to areas affected by \u0027unrest\u0027 or conflicts with our main focus on women and children under the age of 13(thirteen), as statistically are the most affected group in such cases. This will be done by giving and supervising the use of 80% of profits after costs to the rehabilitation process. It is our candid aim to materially reduce the rate of unrest in the world as we know it today. And this project will be key to achieving the said goal.

Ship chandlers, lighter terminals and lighter operators play important roles in the provision of supplies to carriers at sea. A mother vessel will often request for various supplies from a range of different suppliers, either directly or through the services of ship chandlers. In response, these ship suppliers will truck the cargo to pre-arranged lighter boats for final delivery to the mother vessel. Currently, the arrival times of lighter boats and supply trucks are not coordinated, resulting in lengthy wait time for both landside and seaside.

Through her courageous stand up for education to the start of the Malala foundation, we were truly inspired by her moving actions. As we currently live in the heart of technology, we thought we’d use every opportunity we could get to provide an educational platform for everyone. What it does: The app itself will incorporate key GCSE subjects, in which there will be substantial information regarding each subject. It offers features such as quizzes, revision content, video links and progress logs. How we built it: With the generous support of developers and mentors, we were able to produce a beneficial and extraordinary app to support those developing a wider understanding of essential subjects. Challenges we ran into: One concern we endured was the method of which we would obtain income to sustain the app. We easily solved this by brainstorming as a team, possible solutions. Accomplishments we are proud of: A major accomplishment we have achieved is being able to meet inspirational individuals of all ages, who are all passionate about technology and helping others. We have made links with many which we hope to maintain even after this event. What we learnt: We now know much more about technology and entrepreneurship and are aware of the fact that age is simple a number and doesn’t restrict what we are able to achieve.

When times get tough, people often ask family and friends to pray for them. But what if they are not in the habit of praying? Or what if it is something too personal to share with them? Meet Pray It Forward--a platform that connects people from all walks of life who believe in the power of prayer. Whatever your situation, you can easily find people to pray for you, or if you are here to pray for others, you can write or voice-record your prayer to share with them. And whether you want to stay connected with everybody or only with those who share your beliefs, you will have full control over who is in your network. Pray It Forward is a simple idea--pray for others, have others pray for you, and stay connected with a like-minded community. This is just the beginning. With a common platform connecting everyone who believes in prayer, the possibilities with group praying to create a happier world are endless. Stay tuned. May all be happy. Our Story Our story begins at the TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon 2014 in San Francisco. One of the five team members was facing a problem in his personal life. He was trying to find people to pray for his uncle who was suffering from cancer, but he had a tough time getting help. So we decided to build a product that will make it super easy for anyone to find prayer support. Our simple web prototype of Pray It Forward won two awards: Best Implementation award from Idea Market Most Innovative award from Twilio After the Hackathon, we heard about the Happiness Apps Challenge, and a few of us decided to continue working on this project. We surveyed hundreds of people from diverse backgrounds who believe in praying, and found that: People often need prayers, but they are not sure whom to ask. Some want to pray for others, but they are not sure who needs it. Many struggle to find time for church, but they do want to stay connected with others who share their faith. Almost all believe in praying for others, regardless of what the other person\u0027s religion is. People feel happier after praying for someone. People feel happy just knowing that someone prayed for them, but they would feel even happier if they could actually hear the person praying. Pray It Forward has been completely redesigned to address the above findings, and will soon be available in Google Play Store. For now, you can download and install the app by following this link on your Android phone: http://goo.gl/YY3xmE Challenges Since prayer is universal, Pray It Forward is not associated with any particular religion. However, we realize that some people would feel more comfortable limiting their activity to only those who share their faith. So, we have designed it such that users will have the option to customize their network based on religion or denomination. The other challenge was to ensure that people wanting to pray for others are only receiving prayer requests that are relevant to their interests. While one person might be interested in praying for a cancer patient, someone else may be more inclined towards praying about financial hardships. To overcome this challenge, we have built in smart technology which will ensure that people seeking prayers, and people wanting to pray for others, are matched appropriately. By connecting people through prayer, we hope to make this world a happier place! Website Please visit http://prayitforward.co to learn more about our project.

In the age of outsourcing there is a pretty decent chance that one day you come to the office and realise that nobody is there in the middle of the working day or during the estimation meeting. So there is plenty of knowledge and experience about handling estimation meetings without physical presence in the same room. But what to do when your team is outsourced and scattered among different time zones, so there is no opportunity for everyone to meet online? The most common solution (or at least such is my impression) is to ask participants to write their estimates in the comments of your issue tracker, per issue.

Diabetic Neuropathy is a condition often found in diabetic patients. Nearly 60-70 percent of diabetic patients suffer from neuropathy. Patients suffering from neuropathy often lose sensation within their feet, and lower legs. This means that these patients are unaware of what they might be stepping on, and unaware of the amount of pressure they apply to each foot. This leads to more complications such as blisters and ulcers. Our project aims to aid patients lessen the severe effects of DN (Diabetic Neuropathy) and improve the healing process for those with complications caused by DN (i.e. ulcers, blisters, abrasions). Our project does this by collecting real-time foot pressure data on various parts of the feet and offering haptic feedback to help a patient orient his weight differently to prevent excessive pressure at any points. This approach will reduce the number of foot ulcers a DN patient may develop, in addition to helping the healing process. The system consists of two vibrating motors, a spark core, and two force sensitive sensors on both sides of the foot arch, though more can easily be added, and a user interface (mobile/desktop website). As a test case, we assumed a patient who has developed a foot ulcer in the anterior region of their left foot is using our product. The system can be setup to warn the patient when they place too much pressure near the ulcerous area. In order to warn the patient, the system will flash an alert on either the mobile or desktop interface. In addition, there are two vibration motors are worn on a wristband. The motors work independly of each other, one placed higher than the other, to denote posterior and anterior of the foot region. Based on where the pressure is placed, one of the motors will buzz to denote where the patient must shift his weight. Therefore the patient can reliably know how and where to apply pressure to his feet when walking in an effective manner. Thus helping him heal quicker and prevent future ulcers. The graphic interface is a web implementation, designed to be scalable across multiple platforms. It can show the patient the amount of pressure they are putting on each position in their foot (in Pascals), along with a graphical representation of the current pressure (transparent green to opaque red). It also shows the average pressure, for the patient to monitor themselves over a period of time. Eventually, as data accumulates, the circular graph will make it more evident to ultimately know how evenly a user is distributing weight. The webpage can also flash alerts to notify users of an imbalance. In the future, we plan on adding better and more accurate sensors to get greater precision when creating foot pressure maps. With some more backing, we could also integrate our DIY sensor technology into the sole of the shoe itself. With better sensors, we will also be able to perform accurate weight tracking (for which we already have an algorithm) of a patient by simply standing on the shoes. Caution! A few values in the source code are calibrated specifically for these sensors, which were made using DIY materials for this particular project. The values given are good estimates and indicators of pressure change, but they are not comparable to the accuracy nor precision of more advanced hardware.

We were aiming at creating a new kind of creative collaboration app, so we decided to target music. What it does The goal of this project was to build a sequencer without any third-party component such as flash, or any sound files, using only HTML5 WebAudio API. Because Polytunes mathematically calculates note within musical scales, it is easy for everyone to create melodies without prior theoretical knowledge about music. Not only it enables people to witness other\u0027s creativity in realtime thanks to Meteor, but it also gives everyone the ability for several players to collaborate on the same piece of music. It can be used as a teaching tool to learn about musical scales, harmony, rythm or collaborative creation, as a creative tool to compose melodies, or just as a fun game that matches words or drawings to music. How we built it We used meteor to enable real-time collaboration and a Javascript library called Wad that is a wrapper around HTML5 WebAudio API. Challenges we ran into The only difficulty we had to face was that one of our collaborator, that had to leave the hackathon early, was so addicted to Polytunes that he actually couldn\u0027t stop playing event at home. Because we had no way of contacting him beside drawing pixel art style words with Polytunes, it made it very difficult for us to create the presentation screen capture video. What we learned We were all beginners with meteor but we found that it was very easy to use to quickly build a responsive and dynamic web-app. What\u0027s next for Polytunes We\u0027d like to add the ability to create public and private rooms which url can be shared with friends or on social networks. We currently used a lot of default settings that would be settable by user, such as tempo, pitch, musical scale, board size, etc. We also would love to build Polytunes as a native app for mobile devices that could allow both solo offline and collaborative online play.

{"likes":67,"hackathon":"Meteor Global Distributed Hackathon","winner":false,"name":"REST2DDP","blurp":"Publish a live updating DDP API for any existing REST API with no coding required","description":"Inspiration At OK GROW! most apps we build need to integrate with a legacy REST API of some sort. Meteor of course provides simple functions for making raw HTTP calls but once you\u0027ve been working with DDP for a while you don\u0027t want to go back. We picture a world where developers demand a DDP API (remember when developers overthrew their SOAP overlords in the Great RESTful API Revolution of 2006?) and we want to make it easier for legacy apps to produce a live updating DDP API. What it does You have a service which provides a REST API but the world wants it as a live updating DDP API. With just some simple configuration you can add a DDP API to your site. http://rest2ddp.meteor.com/ You can create configurations for REST API endpoints, and the system makes a DDP subscription available. You define the following: URL for the REST API endpoint A JSONPath expression that describes where to find an array in that response Some variables that can be substituted at the time of subscription (e.g. ids, url parameters, auth tokens, etc). The name of the collection that the data will go into How often to poll for updates How we built it It\u0027s a Meteor app that lets you store descriptions of REST API endpoints (URL, etc). For each one it provides a publication that can be subscribed to by any DDP client. The core of the app is a Meteor.publish function that connects to a REST API. It loads the data, parses out an array and converts that array into documents that get published to the client. It then continues to poll the REST endpoint until the subscription is stopped (on a frequency that you define), comparing the new results with the previous and sending just the changes over the DDP connection to the subscribed client. Meteor packages accounts-github accounts-ui aldeed:autoform aldeed:collection2 aldeed:simple-schema check http kadira:blaze-layout kadira:flow-router less momentjs:moment mquandalle:jade twbs:bootstrap random reactive-var Npm packages deep-diff jsonpath moniker Challenges we ran into Efficiency We used an object diffing library that should be able to efficiently give us just the changes so that we send the minimal changes to the subscribed client. But due to time constraints we\u0027re not taking full advantage of the diff library right now and our DDP updates are not as efficient as they should be. There are two issues: Unfortunately we can\u0027t tell yet that an object was inserted into the array and the following items just shifted down, currently all items after the inserted one will appear as changes. Very inefficient. Changes should be just the (top-level) field that changed. Right now we send the whole object (all fields). The diff library can tell us exactly which fields changed but we\u0027re not using it. Usability It\u0027s challenging to design a UI that\u0027s self-explanatory enough for a casual user or hackathon judge to grasp immediately. We didn\u0027t have time to iterate on the UI. Accomplishments that we\u0027re proud of We built something useful in 24 hours! Variable substitution allows creating publications that are general and can be used by a variety of clients without hardcoding authentication, etc. Live previewing of the API call results is pretty cool. What we learned There is a lot of variety and very little standard in the ways that REST APIs do authentication. 24 hours is a short time but with Meteor we can get a lot done :-) What\u0027s next for REST2DDP Improvements to the app More robust error handling and general bug fixing Support XML-based REST APIs Allow setting custom HTTP headers and auth Allow specifying a field from the response to use as a unique id Extract the core functionality into a package that can be used by Meteor apps without needing to use our service. Improve the diffing and fix the inefficient publishing of changes UI improvements, e.g. grouping publications together, changing the route for each saved configuration. Allow keeping some publications private Clean up some nasty parts of the code Support APIs that return only a single item (currently we expect an array) Scaling \u0026 performance Reduce load on REST APIs: ensure that multiple subscriptions to the exact same API with the same variables share the same HTTP requests to the REST API. Create a package We would like to see Meteor come to mind immediately for developers who are looking to put a new UI in front of a legacy app with a RESTful API, rather than being considered for new app development only. Front-end only frameworks tend to grow in popularity much faster than full-stack frameworks because there are so many developers with legacy apps that want to update the UI without rebuilding the entire app. A hosted service is good for an API provider who wants to provide a DDP API without doing more work, it can be thought of like a proxy. But a developer who wants to consume a REST API might not want to go through a hosted proxy and might want to be able to subscribe to REST API\u0027s directly within their app. So we would like to extract the core functionality into a package so that any Meteor app can easily subscribe to a REST API and receive live updates over DDP.

We want to empower students to make money while helping their peers. In essence, we see the college campus as a dense network of people who can share resources and time to create a powerful community. Fireflies is our way of redefining the sharing economy on college campuses. What it does My friends and I often stay up late at night for exams. We miss out on eating dinner, and after midnight, ordering food is no longer a possibility. At the same time, there are numerous students that are out and about at that time. They pass by restaurants, grocery stores, or even coffee shops. Using the Fireflies app, I can request a meal from Taco Bell or any other local restaurant that does not have its own delivery. The app leverages the Alohar API and notifies someone inside the restaurant, passing by, or just around the corner. With the granular details Alohar provides, our algorithm quickly matches students requesting food with people in the vicinity of that restaurant. Once a match is found, the transaction for the food goes through and Fireflies escrows the money using Braintree. Once my peer brings me the food, the payment is released. How we built it We built Fireflies with Alohar as a native Android app from scratch for the very first time this August. We aimed to leapfrog off of other existing solutions, and accordingly we integrated several APIs and material design strategies to really vibe with our users. Additionally, we tinkered with delivery ideas in the past and created mockups and surveys to understand user behavior. However we never were able to build a comprehensive solution till now. Until we found Alohar, there was no good way to efficiently track our users and develop a context specific algorithm to enable delivery. We are excited to release this app, complete with designs based off actual user feedback, Alohar integration, and payment systems. Challenges we ran into One non-obvious challenge that we ran into while building Fireflies was that our users really didn’t know what to expect when we did user testing. The idea of our app was originally much broader, and we gave users lots of control in the app to to order anything and get it delivered anywhere. (One use case was getting problem sets handed in by peers for their classes). We left a text box for the users to enter what they needed and how much they’d pay. However this was challenging in that the users didn’t know what to put in the text boxes, and if they did, they didn’t know how much to pay. We solved this by eliminating user inputs and giving them a few options with predetermined prices. The app became much smoother, and we noticed a visible improvement in user happiness. This sort of standardization required that we do a lot of work on the backend. When we integrated locations and routes along with pricing, we needed to automate the process to be extremely precise. Alohar provided the information we needed and helped us apply it well within the context of the problem we were trying to solve. Accomplishments that I\u0027m proud of Getting the most out of the Alohar API is something we are extremely proud of. Alohar provides us with insights on where a user\u0027s home location and work location could be. We use that data to extrapolate where the user is going. By taking into consideration several contextual nodes such as time of day, user\u0027s past transactions, direction user is heading, and other deliveries being done at that moment, we create optimal matches that saves buyers time and money. In the same way, we optimize routes for deliverers so that they can make the most money possible and complete several deliveries in one go. What started out as a simple hack ended up providing convenience for people ordering on the go. The app is also a quick and efficient way for other student to make money without going out of their way. Our team is extremely proud of the fact that we can bring people together, empower them to earn, and provide this instant convenience at the tap of a button. We have placed a lot of attention on a seamless user experience. The way we integrated the Alohar API drives our real time, context-based deliveries. Compared to other conventional food delivery applications, we save time and money for the people who order. Likewise, we are extremely proud of nurturing a community where people can mutually benefit from helping one another. In many ways, we are reinventing the traditional supply chain of ordering and delivering. Thanks to Alohar, we were also able to build on existing user behavior rather than forcing users to change what they do and where they go everyday. We are proud of championing Fireflies as a seamless convenience that makes communities stronger. What I learned As active entrepreneurs, we are constantly hit with an abundance of advice and strategies in creating a product. However, we have found that the only sure way to absorb this advice is to actually go out to the market, talk to our target audience, reflect on our own experiences as potential users, and iterate based on the data we collected. We have obtained insights that we never could have gotten from listening to people speak. We have a persistent, never-give-up attitude and are excited to launch Fireflies equipped with Alohar at college campuses around the country. What\u0027s next for Fireflies We will launch Fireflies at MIT and Drexel for Fall 2015. As we scale and gain traction we will expand to other schools in Boston and Philadelphia. Our goal is to reach a certain number of daily transactions at each campus we launch at before expanding. We will want to build a rating system and partner with nearby restaurants to make ordering food even more convenient. A long term vision we have for Fireflies is to expand to other communities on a global scale. We see communities that are well connected among neighbors, friends, family members, coworkers, and more. Colleges are a starting point, but we want to keep building, pivoting and tailoring this service to empower different communities across the world.

{"likes":45,"hackathon":"Hsuehshan Tunnel Transformer","winner":false,"name":"APP+Website台灣雪隧疏流","blurp":"We build a real time and potential software to help both residents and official to reduce and control car flow.","description":"雪隧疏流計畫講解 中文簡介 我們訪問了數位交通專業的教授並蒐集7篇相關文獻，制定出一個app+website的方案來解決雪隧問題，主要從減少車輛及車輛管控下手! 可以去試試網頁或是google play下載我們的App喔～ （連結在最下面） Inspiration    According to \"Impact analysis of transportation capability by speed limit in xueshan tunnel\",the loading capacity in hsuehshan tunnel is 2400 car numbers per hour, but now it often over 5000 car numbers per hour. The car flow in highway greatly exceed the capacity, which cause serious traffic jam. To solve this problem, there are two aspects that we can do. First, reduce the car flow in traffic. Second, control the traffic flow in hsuehshan tunnel. The detailed information is as followed.\n 1. Reduce car flow In traffic transport industry, modal switching is a great way to decrease traffic flow. However, there are several disadvantages to ban users from these methods. For example, it is too inconvinient. Users have to search buses, trains and all kinds of public transport ways and they even have to find out how they move whey they are in Ilan. The result is they just give up and drive their own cars. Besides, people don\u0027t know what they get if they switch other modals, such as, how much time or money they can save. This is a huge problem because bus can afford 5 times of people compared with private cars. To sum up, we want to be a platform that resolve inconvinent problems. We will collect all kinds of information they need and provide some discounts to add incentives. These can encourage people use public transports system and alternative ways to reduce car flows. 2. Control car flow in highway According to ”Franks Self-organized lane formation and optimized traffic flow in army ants,” if the car numbers per hour exceed 3000, the traffic jam will naturaly happen. We have to control the car flow to prevent natural traffic jam. Reservation system is a good way to control and estimate the car flow for concerned authorities to make further decisions. We can distribute the flow and warn people the expected jam. If we accumulate enough data, we can even give more information to residents. Thus, we want to distribute the flow into reserved lane and normal lane in some serious times like holidays or weekend. Buses and people who reserve on our app can drive on this lane (like high occupancy vehicle lane). Peolpe who want to save time and don\u0027t follow the rules drive on reserved lane. We will punish them with the help of eTag and License Plate Recognition System. In conclusion, our idea is using carrot and stich approaches. On one hand, we encourage and make it easier for residents to use public transport ways. On the other hand, we strictly control flow on highway and give severe punishment who want to save time and break the rules. These income can use for subsidy of local residents. What it does We are a software that are useful for both people transports between Taipei and Yilan and concerned authorities. For people transports between Taipei and Yilan, they can easily grab needed information and compare all ways in our app. For example, they can see which way is faster and cheaper now. Besides, we even provide discounts and booking system in our software. We can give some incentives to seduce them using public transport system. If they want to take the bus, they can book it immediately; if they decide to drive, they can reserve for reserved lane. They can use our services with app and website anytime anywhere. For concerned authorities, we are a real time supervisory control system. We can collect how many people book for reserved lane and they can make further modification. For instances, if they know around 2000 cars will influx into the system, they can distribute the lane or even suggest some users set off earlier with our serivce. They can also combine it with eTag and License Plate Recognition System to get some important parameters or charge higher with these users. We can control it better but not like now depend on police officiers\u0027 instinction. In conclusion, we are a two-way solutions for users and officiers. There will be a synergy effect if we can connect users and officiers with our services. How I built it There are three stages we do. First, data collection, including Field research, collection of scientific papers and so on. We visit Ilan to observe the problem for over 5 times. Besides, we interview 2 professors who know transportation information industry throughly and read over 20 papers and articles. Second, policy development. We discuss for over 10 solutions like lower interval, combination with OpenXC and so on. We discuss with more than 10 local residents to make sure find out a great solution. Third, software construction. We write a \"real time\" app and website. In front-end, we first draw manuscripts and discuss UI/UX for 2 weeks. In the back-end, we host a server in Amazon, and run a NoSQL database. We build a real time connection with web socket that can change information immediately when the database change. We also developed a web crawler to crawl information from official websites. Challenges I ran into The largest challenge we met is how to apply theory into real world. We are students from transportation management and chemical engineering and have some experences in software development. We have to figure out the problem first and apply what we learn in class to solve the problem. It s really a great challenge because real world is not that easy. For example, we want to apply transport formula to calculate capacity. However, the turbulent system do not follow the parameters. When we personally observe in the highway, we found that many parameters are wrong in real case. We concurred a hard time to find out a solution with support of theory. Accomplishments that I\u0027m proud of  We really involved into this project and challenge ourselves. In order to solve this complex problem, we not only investigate it from several aspects like transportation management, policy, chemical engineering, software and psychology, we also run through almosot the whole process of a product\u0027s develpment. For example, although we study chemical engineering, we tried to use the knowledge of fluid mechanics into solving this complicated traffic flow problem. We thing out of the box and solve the problem with Interdisciplinary cooperation. Most important of all, as a resident in Luodong, we can solve our own issues and help the society is a great honor!\n What I learned  First, we learn that to solve a huge problem, we have to combine all kinds of professions. Only with cross-border cooperation, we will earn the opportunity to deal with tough issues. This project encourage us to learn more and build our professions to help the world be a better place with our strong abilities. Second, of course, we realize more about Hsuehshan Tunnel and Ilan. We are more connected with our mother land. Besides, scold is easier than construction. We should not scold the government or others because it is really difficult to construct a good policy or solution. \n What\u0027s next for hsuehshantunnel The logic will not change. Reduce or control the car flow in highway. First, we think that goverment should have a stronger execution. For example, raise the road toll is an effective solution but goverment do not choose this because afraid of lossing the vote. For another example, high occupancy or reserved vehicle lane is also a great solution that many cities use. I think the goverment should be bold! Second, if talk about help with technology. We believe, combination of wisdom mobile system and big data are the future. For example, interval is a really critical key point in solving traffic jam, if intelligent system can automatically control interval between cars, the problem will greatly solved. For another example, with the help of big data, we can predict the car flow and make furthr decisions like distribute car drivers into several differnt times. Last but not least, we think local goverment should do more about local public transport system, many people drive their own cars but not buses because they think it is too inconvinent in Yilan.   \n Reference Lane Reservation for Highways (Position Paper) IMPACT ANALYSIS OF TRANSPORTATION CAPABILITY BY SPEED LIMIT IN XUESHAN TUNNEL Franks Self-organized lane formation and optimized traffic flow in army ants http://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id\u003d117065 http://www.pilotonline.com/news/local/transportation/why-traffic-flow-slows-when-drivers-hit-tunnels/article_83519484-e462-5955-bc85-afb20bb653a5.html Built With javascript jquery json bootstrap meteor.js ionic Try it out hsuehshantunnel.theclipo.com play.google.com theclipo.com","technologies":["javascript","jquery","json","bootstrap","meteor.js","ionic"],"authors":["winson huang","YuHuai Chen","Michael Huang"]},

Guide them through the river \u0026 collect magical fruit.","description":"LILY PAD - STORY: The two Lily Pad characters, Willie and Dee, are on a mission to save their town. Their town has been dry for years, and crops and food are running out. They need to bring back enough food to save the town from starving. Legends say that there is a magical river where you can find endless fruit; with one bite of this fruit, you are nourished for months. Willie and Dee travel on their lily pad along the magical river. Their job is to collect as much fruit as they can to bring back home. Help guide them through the river, collecting all the fruit possible, but watch out for logs, animals and other challenges along the way. GAME DESCRIPTION - CONTROLS \u0026 MECHANICS: Lily Pad is a game uniquely focused on storytelling. When you’re playing the game, there is an emotional connection with the story, and with Willie and Dee; you are invested in their success! As you put on the headset, you will be immersed into a cinematic introduction with the backstory told for the Lily Pad game. As you begin playing the game, your job is to help the two main characters, Willie and Dee, collect as much fruit as possible as they travel on their lily pad. As Willie and Dee travel down the river, you’ll be able to swipe forward using the trackpad on the Samsung Gear VR to navigate, and tap to shoot down the fruit. There are 4 levels in the Lily Pad game, with each level having a different theme. You will encounter different animals and experiences in each level. The animation will be unique according to how Willie and Dee catch the fruit, how you shoot at the fruit, how you shoot to free up logs, and how you interact with the environment. Combined, this variety has enhanced the entertainment factor. INNOVATION: Lily Pad has integrated innovative concepts around user cues, locomotion techniques and immersion. User cues: When Willie or Dee need your help, or if you’re not paying attention while being immersed in the game, the characters will call for your help. It was essential to determine the right speed for the lily pad to move down the river, as when the user is immersed in the forest, there is a lot of see, shoot at, and explore. At the same time, you need to help Wille and Dee collect fruit. To reconcile this, there are audio and animation cues to call the user’s attention to the lily pad periodically. Locomotion techniques: It was important for us to figure out the camera speed as you move forward across the landscape. When the camera moves too fast, or when the camera stops suddenly, users are likely to feel motion sickness. Finding the correct speed was crucial. In addition, to reduce motion sickness, we realized how important it was to have other creatures and visuals within the environment on which to focus your attention. Immersion: Implementing the swipe function for the camera to move forward greatly improved the immersive experience. It’s certainly important for the user to be able to control his/her movement. As part of the immersion, you’re able to shoot more than fruit - such as rocks, hidden turtles and foxes. The user wants to enjoy and interact with the environment while also completing the game, which is why the swipe function was innovatively employed.

We are all used to playing First Person Shooter but with DRIFT wanted to create something different : a game in which the player embodies the bullet itself. Let\u0027s see where a bullet which has a consciousness is going ... GAME Fly through immersive suspended scenes in a four floors building and try to find your way between gangsters and obstacles until you hit the right target! For in game views, check the video above that shows the game as it is in the GearVR during a playing session. Gameplay The gameplay is very simple and intuitive : tap once on the GearVR touchpad to start. as a bullet you’re moving forward all the time. turn your head in any direction to orient your path. touch the GearVR touchpad to enter super slow motion mode. try to find your green target. Design For the visual part we wanted to give DRIFT a very radical identity with strong design choices. Everything in the game is drawn by orange shaded lights and shadows that reveal silhouettes and obstacles on the white background. Only bonuses and the target are green, contrasting with the rest of characters and objects. Since the player is not allowed to hit anything in the environment, we decided to design the game with neat white low poly models looking like sculptures in a museum. This concept makes sense with the gameplay and enforces the atmosphere of suspended time and space. Low poly models and static objects were also perfectly fitting with the mobile development constraints. Even if we created a suspended environment we didn\u0027t want it to look too static. That\u0027s why we designed multiple set up and characters in very expressive attitudes, interacting with each other, objects and environment, telling stories at every corner of the game. When flying through these scenes, the player leaves a red trail behind, fixing his previous paths in space to help him to improve and optimize the next move. We paid a particular attention to level design and made everything so you never need to turn your head more than 90 degrees at once or look back. As any \"die \u0026 retry\" you play for a short time and the player can take some time to rest between sessions. Each of the four level can be completed in less than a minute so you’re not constantly moving around and forcing on your neck. To make the final level a bit more challenging, we rotated the camera\u0027s initial position. This result in a very disorienting experience for the player but keep being confortable enough to play. To add fun and challenge to the experience, we integrated a high score ranking based on time you took to find and hit the target. There is also three bonuses to find in each level that will unlock achievements and refill your super slow motion bar. Sound For the music we wanted something that was embracing the gangster/museum atmosphere and tried many musics and styles. Finally we came up with these tracks mixing Hip Hop and Classical music that create a weird, speedy, epic and aerial mood at the same time. In addition to all the musics we put sounds on each object in the scene depending on his material. When the player hits an obstacle he instantly gets an audio feedback. We also implemented textual feedbacks that give you informations about the object you hit, makes fun of you or gives you some tips.

Find Taxi Renting Services using your current location or by entering an address so as to Carpool with Friends, Families, Business Partners and Loved Ones. 3.) Get directions straight to the Taxi Services Agency. 4.) See Taxi Agency availability in real-time (where available) 5.) Find opening hours, up to date prices, payment methods and more 6.) Quickly narrow down Taxi choices using filters such as free, credit cards accepted, covered, etc. 7.) Ability to contact the Taxi Services Agency Via SMS. 8.) Ability to know the Distance of Coverage between two stations. A Taxi Driver driving from Tacubaya to Tenayuca could be able to know the distance of coverage in Miles, Hours and could be able to estimate the amount of fuel needed for the travel all by Leveraging OpenXc Dataset. 9.) Mexico City User could be able to Visualize the graphical analysis of fuel Consumption over time via OpenXc Dataset and could be able to estimate the fuel cost from one locatio to another. How the online/digital service improves on traditional approaches Traditional car navigations systems to date haven\u0027t successfully tackled the problem of allowing the Mexico City Users to easily search for and locate the best possible Taxi Services Agency for a particular journey or Carpooling. To do this well requires an exhaustive database of Taxi Services locations as well as additional metadata such as real-time and historical Taxi availability, payment costs and methods, possible height restrictions, opening hours, location of entrance and exists, disabled facilities, etc... The Mexico City Taxi system provides this and more via access to its\u0027s database of Taxi Agency locations. How to Use this app. Call up the application as no registration is required. Search Taxing Eg. Search Nearby Taxi,then Navigate to Google Map and Pick any nearby taxi of interest via Google Map Icon. Tap on it and Click on GetInfo. The App will automatically provides you all the information need about that Taxi Services Agency Like Address, Phone Numbers, Taxi Websites, Working Hours, Taxi Location Latitudes and Longitudes, Payment Methods,Taxi Services Descriptions etc. This will help Mexico Users in knowing the best Taxi suitable for their Journey or Carpoolings with Friends and other People. Mexico City Users could be able to contact the Taxi Agency via SMS push all within the app system. Mathematical Computation of OpenXc Dataset: Hi, Ford: Do you know Why I Prefer mathematics to any other subject. This is because Mathematics is just the Alphabets with which God has written the Universe. Again in Mathematics, I prefer Theory to Objective Questions, This is because even if I don\u0027t get the real answers, but every single mathematical steps one takes has a mark applied to it. Am just trying this OpenXc Dataset for the first time after a friend told me that He needed to have a software that could help him to estimate the Fuel Consumption, amount of fuel needed for a driver to travel from one location to another and Time duration coverage as they move from one point to another. Here is how I implemented OpenXc Dataset. 1.) I exported OpenXc Dataset to enable Mexico City Drivers to graphically visualized the fuel consumption over time coverage. 2.) To calculate the fuel estimate over time and distance of coverage between two points, I first implored Google Map Longitude \u0026 Latitude data extraction and further analyze the distance using Haversine Equation. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) 3.) For Instance leveraging OpenXc Dataset to check Fuel_Consumed_Since_Restart over time. {\"name\":\"fuel_consumed_since_restart\",\"value\":0.440385,\"timestamp\":1406290551.503} {\"name\":\"fuel_consumed_since_restart\",\"value\":0.440465,\"timestamp\":1406290551.614} From the data above, you can see that: at Fuel Value: 0.440385 the time was 1406290551.503 at Fuel value: 0.440465 the time was 1406290551.614 To get the time duration for fuel consumed at the fuel value, I implored a module that convert Unit Timestamp to Hours:Minutes:Seconds 1406290551.503 \u003d\u003d 18:03:46 1406290551.614 \u003d\u003d 18:10:26 Then I implore another Modules that converts the time formats to above to minutes Eg. 18:03:46 \u003d\u003d 1083 18:10:26 \u003d\u003d 1090 Therefore Time Difference 1090-1083 \u003d7minutes. To check Fuel Consumption every Minutes 0.440385 / 7 \u003d\u003d 0.06293 Litres Therefore every 1 minutes the fuel consumption is 0.06293 L. Okay, For instance a Driver traveling from Rio de los Remedios to San Lazaro. I implored Google Map Extraction which was futher analyzed using Haversine Equations. Google Map Integration\u0026 Haversine Equations Mathematical Analysis for example indicates that Traveling Distance from Rio de los Remedios to San Lazaro is 1 hour 8 Minutes (01:08) To Check the Fuel Consumption estimate for 1 hour 8 Minutes Drive become 0.06293 x 68 \u003d\u003d 4.2788028571429 Therefore fuel consumption is about: 4.2788028571429 Litres All this computational data are sent to users Mobile Devices Via SMS OpenXc Data Source AIIMS_to_New_Delhi_Railway.json Thank You Built With google-maps sms openxc Try it out fredcare.com","technologies":["google-maps","openxc"],"authors":["Fredrick Esedo"]},

I came to the outbox incubator with this love of politics and an interest in STEM but particularly in technology. I took inspiration from the variety of speakers who came in and started brainstorming a few initial ideas I had. The concept of an app that brings together all the information from across the internet on the activities of parliament and presents it in a simple, accessible and interactive format really struck a cord. As an AS-level politics student I discovered that political participation is very low in the UK particularly when compared to participation in other nations with general election turnouts of 66.1% compared with 85.8% in Sweden. An app that makes political participation easier and more informal could raise levels of political participation, particularly among 16-24 year olds of whom 90% have access to a smartphone. By integrating politics into their daily routine through a fun app and notifications on updates I aim to increase their interest and participation levels. It would work through a simple app interface which users could log into using their Facebook and Google accounts, and the only other information required would be their post code to ensure they can see their MP\u0027s profile. From there users could vote on whether they agree or disagree with their MP\u0027s votes in the House of Commons which would affect their approval rating as well as exploring the other pages of the app. There would be a page on legislation currently in parliament which users can explore by either issue topic or date modified. There is also a page on the political parties in order to show which parties are the most rebellious, their key policies of the moment and links to the profiles of party leadership figures. A news page is also a feature which would stream in conversations with political hashtags from across social media. The more button will always feature a simple glossary so that if people don\u0027t understand political jargon they can click on the word to find out more, making the app as accessible as possible. The more button will also have changing features that reflect current political events, for instance featuring profiles of the Labour leadership candidates and candidates for the London mayoral elections. What\u0027s Up Gov? is currently still in it\u0027s early stages although I have encountered a few challenges in trying to design the logo and interface. Mostly they were due to a slight lack of skills but i have skilled up very quickly in the past week and a half in order to create a mockup, brand and feature set which accurately reflects my vision for What\u0027s Up Gov? I\u0027m very proud of being able to get from the initial ideation stage to a pitch-able product that I can now begin development on in the space of a week and a half. I\u0027m also proud of the networking and connections I have built within this process that will enable me to take What\u0027s Up Gov? even further. I\u0027ve learnt that the best ideas come when you collaborate and discuss concepts with people, bouncing problems and solutions off of one another to build a better product idea. I\u0027ve also learnt how much work it takes to produce a viable idea and pitch as well as the skills required to pitch it well. Next for What\u0027s Up Gov? is the development stage and creating a minimum viable product in order to release it to politics students across the country to test features and provide feedback. From there I would look to market it and expand the user base to other young people in the UK before targeting the wider electorate as a whole.

{"likes":52,"hackathon":"Mexico City Mobility Challenge","winner":false,"name":"Mx-City Carpology","blurp":"Metrobus Seat Booking,Chating, Reports, Making Friends, Public and Private Carpooling has been easier than ever....","description":"Mx-CITY CARPOOLOGY Metrobus is one of the Largest Transit Agency that operates in Mexico City with their buses covering almost all the major bustops, routes within the City. This app is built by leveraging Haversine Equations, SMS, Mexico City GTFS Dataset and Metrobus Time Operation details from Metrobus Transit Agency Website. (MB,Metrobús:) http://www.metrobus.df.gob.mx/ Mexico GTFS Dataset Implored could be found below: Mexico City GTFS Dataset: http://transitfeeds.com/p/mexico-city-federal-district-government/70 Metrobus Time Operation Schedule: http://www.metrobus.df.gob.mx/rutas.html Haversine Equation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula Mx-City Carpoology is an application that lets Mexico City Users to easily Book a seat on Metrobus Transit, Makes Friends,Chat,Send Road Event Reports, embark on both Public and Private Carpooling all powered by SMS and Metrobus GTFS Dataset in Mexico City. Can I hear Mexico City Government saying that: 1.) Most of traffic in Mexico City is caused by empty Vehicle crowding the road and Rush hours account for a large portion of each day (6-9:30am / 4:30-8:30pm) 2.) Can I see Mexico City creating Hoy No Circula program which restricts driving on a schedule determined by a colored sticker based on a vehicle’s license plate number. All vehicles subject to the program are prevented from driving between 5AM and 10PM one day per week, and some or all Saturdays each month. 3.) Many More issues. I tell Mexican City Judges that all this are not a problem. With Introduction of Mx City Carpoology, all Mexico City Road traffic, Carbon Emissions, Fuel Wastage etc is now a history. What I built An app that Lets Mexico City Users easily: 1.) Access all Route and Bustop application Served by Metrobus Transit Agency in Mexico City 2.) Access the realtime Arrival \u0026 Depature Time for Metrobuses at all stations within Mexico City. 3.) Easily Book a Seat on Metrobus Transit from any bustop within Mexico City \u0026 can opt any time by clicking on delete button. The app assign each Users who wants to board on transit a Seat numbers based on first come, first Serve. 4.) Easily send an SMS Notification messages whenever a user books a seat from any Bustop station serviced to Metrobus Transit Agency. 5.) Easily send Automatic SMS BRoadcast to Metrobus Transit Agency 30 Minutes before the bus arrival along with detail informations like the total number of people who booked a seat from various Bustops and now waiting for Metrobus at that stations. This will enable Metrobus Agency to know the number of Buses that will be sent to that bustop to compensate to all the booked Seats at each bustop. 6.) Each Users already knows where to seat as the app has already assign each user a seat number during booking. 7.) You can easily know the next person that will be seating beside you, his/her name, Male or Female. 8.) Easily Meet and Chat with New People on Daily basis, Make new Friends, share chat text messages and Photos. 9.) Can easily place a special order with Metrobus Transit via Special Bus Booking or Hiring. 10.) Can easily setup the time and date that you want to carpool with friends, People. 11.) Can easily specified the number of people that will be traveling with You. 12.) Automatic appearance within the Metrobus Calendering system each time a Special Carpooling Order is booked or placed. 13.) Automatic SMS notification alert 1 hour before the actual date and Time you and your friends are to carpool. 14.) An advanced SMS Reports system that enable Mexico City Users to easily send SMS Reports to Metrobus Transit Agency in the event of any issues at various bustop within Mexico City...... How the app works. The app has 3 major components: 1.) Public Carpooling: This components enable Mexico City users to board on a Public Metrobus Transit and carpool just with the member of the public. To do this, The user just login and can navigate to all the bustop and routes covered by Metrobus Transit. The User choose her routes from her nearest bustop. For instance a User who is at San Lazaro bustop but wants to travel to Tenayuca will see her route immediately along with information\u0027s regarding Metrobus Arrival \u0026 Departure time. Because Mexico City Users needs to know how long it will take her to reach her destination. I implored Haversine Equation to calculate the distance between two locations.For example the traveling distance between San Lazaro to Tacubaya can be expressed in Miles, Nautic Miles, Kilometers, Meters, Yards and Feets using mathematical computation of Haversine Formula. For every Bustop and Routes, the app displays all the Mexico City Users who has already booked Seat that Day and who also like traveling on that route on daily basis. To board on, you have to clicks on Book a Seat.The app will automatically generate a seat number for each user with which she can use to enter the bus when Metrobus arrives. This eliminate any struggles for the seat and the sitting on Metrobus Transit will be based on first come first serve. Upon each seat booking, the app sends an SMS notifications to Metrobus transit Agency to Inform them that a User just booked a seat from any particular Bustop that is being served by Metrobus Agency. Below is the screen shot of the SMS Messages sent to Metrobus via their Phone No. To make things easier for Metrobus Transit Agency and Mexico City Users, when it\u0027s 30 Minutes to the Metrobus arrival at any stations within the Mexico City. The app will automatically send SMS alert to Metrobus Agency before the actual arrival and departure time of Metro-buses at each stations along with the Information regarding the total number of Passengers who has already booked a seat or the total number of passengers waiting at each bustop. This will enable Metrobus Agency to know the number of Buses that will be sent to that bustop to compensate to all the Mexico City Users waiting at each bustop. Below is a screen of automatic SMS sent in 30 minutes to Metrobus Agency before their bus Arrives at any stations within Mexico City. Below is a screen of automatic SMS sent in 30 minutes to Mexico City Users who booked a seat or waiting at any Bustop before bus Arrives at any stations within Mexico City. This early 30 minutes SMS notifications alerts will help Mexico-City users to quickly round off anything they are doing to be able catch up with the ride at their stations When Metrobus arrives, there is no need to start rushing the door since each user is already assign a seat number. Every Mexico City User will already know before hand the next person that will be seating besides him/her,whether Male or Female and His or her name. Click on Connect button to connect to anybody on Metrobus Transit, User can be able to send friend request and engage each other via a chat communications with photo sharing options. 2.) Special Carpooling This components enables Mexico city users to be able to plan special carpoolings with their friends, families,business Partners on special events that does not need public interference. Example of use cases. A.) Planning a Wedding B.) Carpooling with just friends, families, business partners etc. C.) School Run etc. To Use this special components, a User pick her carpooling date and time from the calender, Enter the number of people that will carpool with them and the traveling location. When a Mexico City User placed a Special Order/Booking,the User appears within the Metrobus Transit Calendering systemb and the app will sends an immediate SMS alert to Metrobus Bus Transit along with the detailed information about the User who placed the booking,no of People traveling with Him/Her, carpooling Time etc. Below is a Screenshot of the SMS sent to Metrobus Agency on Special Carpooling Booking This will help Metrobus transit agency in decision making process... Because Mexico City Users need to be notify before their carpooling date and time, The app was programmed to automatically send SMS alerts to all the Users 1 hour before their carpooling time as can be seen in the screenshot below. This will enable the user to make proper preparations with her friends and of course your wife,Girl-Friends,Mummy needs time to dress up, fix her fingers nail, lip sticks, courtest, make ups etc.. Metrobus Agency can easily Tract all the users who place a request by clicking on their Chat heads within the calendering system for data visualisations. 3.) Passenger Reports System This enable Mexico City Users to easily send an sms reports to Metrobus Transit Agency on any issues which may be deemed fit upon road events circumstance. Search-box enable Mexico City Users to search and connect with friends via names and mobile contacts. communications is via text messages with photo sharing options powered by SMS. DataSet Mexico City GTFS Dataset: http://transitfeeds.com/p/mexico-city-federal-district-government/70 Metrobus Time Operation Schedule: http://www.metrobus.df.gob.mx/rutas.html What Next for Metrobus via Mx-City Carpology Apps. 1.) Adding Metrobus Admin Panel to help in advance Management of the system for their Passenger Customers. Building this app on Android, IOS and Windows. 2.) I believe Mexico City Users might also need to how far or close Metrobuses are from each stations. This is extremely simple. There is no need for Beacon Technology because it has limitations. All We need is just Smart Phone or System that will be placed inside the bus with Internet Connections. Google Map Longitude and Latitude data extraction on timely intervals. This data will be processed using Haversine and Vincety Equations. With the value obtained, Mexico City Users who for example is at Ethiopia bustop could be able to predict: A.) How Far or Close. Metrobus are from that stations. B.) Whether if the Metrobus is moving or stationary respect to time. C.) Metrobus Agency will be able to know where their buses are any time anywhere Built With sms Try it out fredcare.com","technologies":[],"authors":["Fredrick Esedo"]},

{"likes":51,"hackathon":"FLIR\u0027s \"Bring the Heat\" Hacker and Maker Challenge (Hong Kong)","winner":true,"name":"TravAlarm","blurp":"A free app that keeps you on track with travel alerts.","description":"Description: TravAlarm was created because people who live in the city that never sleeps can’t afford to be sidetracked by transit delays. Designed by busy technology professionals who were often affected by missed connections and late trains and busses, which made them late to important meetings, TravAlarm presents an effective and fun solution for busy commuters and travelers. This new app will meet an immediate need because according to a​ 2​014 MTA report,​ m​ore and more subway trains are delayed. In a 6% jump in delays from 2013, about 25% of all New York City Transit subway trains from Oct. 2013 through Oct. 2014 were at least five minutes behind schedule. ​All total, 41,547 subway train delays were reported a month during that time — a 51% increase from the 27,457 per month average over the previous 12 months. Co­founder Arka Bala expounds on the creation of TravAlarm: \u0027I got this idea when I took 3 hours to get to work one day due to a subway delay. I could have made it in an hour taking the train if I knew my regular subway station was closed. Straight away I knew that this was a problem that most people face, and an app that could look out for you instead of you having to manually check for delays would be really useful. I really think TravAlarm can help make sure you get to that important meeting on time.\u0027 Available as a free download for Android and iOS8 devices, the TravAlarm app operates as a smart phone journey planner. The user has the ability to set alarms for specific trips and destinations and it differs from other transit apps in that it was uniquely built to a​lert commuters to delays on their usual transportation line and wake them up earlier, or send them notifications when they are prepping for appointments to avoid the hassle of running late and being forced to wait in cold or sweltering hot subway stations or out in the hot sun, rain or snow while waiting for their bus to arrive. Also featured in the app is a built-in music player and alarm clock, which allows commuters to listen to their favorite tunes as they travel and set alarms at different points during their journey. This is great for business travelers who want to take a quick nap between train stops or students who want to make sure they are on time for class. As an additional incentive for travelers, the designers of TravAlarm have also secured several promotional partnerships with local businesses such as coffee shops to reward customers with discounts and other goodies if they find themselves delayed. The promotions show right up in the app and can be redeemed right from their smart phones! TravAlarm is the perfect traveling companion for the o​ver 8 million New Yorkers who use mass transit each week​who want technology that works to make their lives better! TravAlarm Features: Delay Detector: TravAlarm monitors all planned journeys and their components in the background and will warn the user about delays on any of the components. Journey Planner: With TravAlarm users can plan journeys anywhere in the world. One of the interesting features is the over lay of line status / delay information on journey map in the journey planner. We have are mixing line status information with journey panning data to make this possible. Journey Tracker: Users will be able to track various components of the next planned journey if it is a over ground journey and GPS trackable. Ie if a journey comprises of walking, bus, train and subway. The user can track the train journey so that he is notified when he is close to the stop station of that train journey. TravAlarm Pro: TravAlarm Pro to understand user behaviour, engagement level and various analytic \u0026 management tasks. Crowd sourced data stored in TravAlarm backed can be used to predict movement bottlenecks, create user location heat maps for real time and historical analysis. Planned Features: Bluetooth Beacon Navigation: TravAlarm is also designing a feature where bluetooth beacons will be used to navigate users to indoor points of interest. Bluetooth beacons from Sonic Notify (www.sonicnotify.com) which can send beacon data using infra sound and bluetooth is being tested. This indoor navigation beacon network will generate crowd sourced data that will enable TravAlarm to detect where movement bottle necks are. This navigation will also be coupled with text to speech function (described next) that will guide disabled users. Beacons could also enable TravAlarm’s journey tracker feature to work without GPS which means users could be alerted about subway stops close by even when under ground. Text to speech: TravAlarm is designing a feature where notifications and navigation instructions can be spoken to the users via spoken audio instructions. This feature will be beneficial to visually impaired users or users who are listening to music through TravAlarm. About the TravAlarm team: TravAlarm i​s a company dedicated to the creation of applications and products that work to improve the lives of the masses. TravAlarm was born as a solution to the frustrations and delays of public transport suffered by the founders. Motivated by the desire to find a way of avoiding spending hours on cold platforms and being late for meetings, the founders created TravAlarm. Based in New York, London and San Francisco, the team is agile and intent on creating good experiences for its users.

Puzzle your way through the districts to unlock their treasures and discover the key to the heart of the city. Bottles and lanterns and optical devices litter the streets of the glass blowers district, but many are trapped behind stained glass. Can you unlock a way to see through? Wind your way through the laundry lined passages of the textile district and you’ll find a path blocked. Can you find a way through? They key is to look to the stars. The core of the game is a treasure hunting game, collecting patterns of treasures to satisfy the bounty demands through the city, reaping rewards that can be pocketed for future use. As tranquil as this journey is, beware. Sea cobras lurk along the open aqueducts of the city, and something sinister lies in wait through the palace doors. You’ll have to use the skills and instruments you’ve built exploring the city to prevail in the final test of Bazaar. Art Inspired by trips to flea markets and thrift stores and a particular Turkish lantern shop in Carmel, we wanted to make a world full of colorful curiosities. Everyone on our team likes color so we just went for it and developed a blackless palette to keep things vivid and surreal. Controls We had a lot of fun developing controls for the VR to help retain immersion and explore novel UI solutions. In early iterations of the game we found ourselves gazing skyward, so we built an inventory system around constellations. To draw the connection for the player between acquired items and their star inventory, we guide their gaze up with a shooting star. If they look away, the star will freeze and hover mid-path. Its trajectory completes when under the player’s gaze again. This resolves early iteration issues where playtesters were oblivious to additions to their constellation pool. From the sky, players can activate instruments, see their minimap, detect hazards and enemies, and keep track of health. One of the cool instruments in the game is a magic scope. This telescope can be used to peer through colored glass to detect and collect items on the other side. We display the telescopic circle FOV to the right eye, and a blank black screen to the left. Players naturally shut the left eye which is a pretty fun way to simulate using a telescope in VR! We also developed a novel “nod gesture” to allow players to pace their tutorials. We found getting the player to look in the direction of their movement through turns helps to reduce motion sickness, so we came up with some tricks to incentivize this behavior. For example we tuned when a player can register an upcoming turn. We also found we can accelerate the player linearly through the labyrinth as long as they are looking in the direction of travel. We use this in compass mode, when players can control their speed. Technology Everything in this game was made exclusively for this jam! We started with our own custom mostly-2D game engine. We added many systems including VR rendering, skinned animations, android drivers, 3D sound, and a 3D asset pipeline. Although the off the shelf game engines are great, we enjoy the control we get from a using our own engine and we experimented with many things like crazy sorting and custom shaders. For performance, we experimented with a custom renderer that draws far away objects monoscopically and close by objects in stereo. We develop the performance tools we need like our in-game profiler. But mostly we are just code nuts and like writing game engines! Who are we? We’re a ragtag gang of indies who joined forces to jam on this project together.

{"likes":44,"hackathon":"USDA Innovation Challenge","winner":false,"name":"Agro Companion","blurp":"App that allows USA Farmers to visualized their idea crops and also allows information exchange via a social network","description":"Inspiration: As an IT Scientist, I have little knowledge on Agriculture based on Agric Science I did in Secondary School but this knowledge wasn\u0027t enough so I started interviewing Farmers,Agricultural Lecturers and Students within my area and In my school on what to do to ensure excellent farming, maximum crop yield and to ensure that all this information are passed from one generation of Farmer to another without alteration. The average resopnse I got were stated below. 1.) If appropriate planning are in place regarding financial Capabilities,production cost,crops yields things will be okay. 2.) Testing of soil propertises need to be done to know the crop suitable for a particular Areas. 3.) The major problems faced by farmers are mostly drought, weeds and Insect Attacks. If this can be mitigated, then maximum yield can be expected. 4.) Most Young Agricultural graduates and Farmers lack interest in Farming because of unavailability of Informations on Modern trends in Agriculture. All Professors and all Agricultural Students and graduates in various Universities Points out that If USDA Dataset can be collabrated with Social Network for purpose of Dataset Analysis, Data Visualisation, information Exchange(Just like in Facebook),it will make farming/Agricultural Studies one of the most interesting discipline in the world. For Instance a Young Graduate trying to setup a Soyabeans Farming can immediately leverage USDA Datasets and can share his knowledge, ideas or issues with other Users(Farmers) via a social network thus ensuring information propagation through an unbroken succession from one generation of Farmer to another. Farmers are ensured that any issues on farming can easily be resolved by leveraging USDA Dataset and by other responses from Farmers from various Farming disciplines within the Social Network. What Inspiration \u0026 Interview Lands me into. USDA Dataset is Very Broad though the API Call for each dataset is very simple. Thanks for the USDA Enginneers. From Inspiration above, we all knew that Water(H2O) and Air(O2) are two essential commodities that support human lives. While Human uses Oxygen(O2), plant uses Carbondioxide(CO2) for Photosythesis as can be expressed mathematically in the Photosynthetic Equation Below From the Photosynthetic Equation Above, You can Visualize the quantity of Water and Carbon(iv)Oxide needed as a reactant to yield a Product called Sugar.So from this equation, you can understand that water is very essential for plants growths and crops yield. Consequently, lack of water commonly known as DROUGHT can be disasterous to plants as it can inhibits photosynthesis in plants and can lead to little or no crop yield or the plant may even die off due to lack of water. What I built An app that allows American Farmers to visualized their idea crops,predicts production cost, knows the favourable state for growing a particullar crop, visualized the amount of water needed(eg. Irrigated Water,Ground Water, Surface Water) and quantity of crops yields in Bushels over time. The app also allows information exchange between Farmers via a social network. The App leverages Irrigation Technology \u0026 Water Use (ARMS DATASET 1999-2006). What this App Does Components A: USDA Data Visualisations The App leverages Irrigation Technology \u0026 Water Use (ARMS DATASET 1999-2006). From the USDA Dataset above, we picked up two crops (Soyabeans and Corn) so we started with Soyabeans as a case study via the API Call. so the app were able to integrate all Planted Acres, Irrigated Acres, the ground water usage, surface water usage and irrigated water used on the crop(Soyabeans) and amount of products yields(Bushels) per application over time(eg 2006,2002,2000,1999 etc..). This datasets were collected for every states in United States. All this datasets were dynamically created via API Call to deploy Data Visualization components and statistical graphs were ploted using Bar Charts, Column Charts,Aggregated Area Chart and Pie Chart distribution Analysis over time. With this Graphs Visualization Components, Farmers can be able to Visualized graphs Dataset on each states in USA on crops Yields(eg.Soyabeans) over time(eg year 2006,2002,2000,1999 etc) For instance in Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska etc........Farmer can graphically visualize over time, A.) Amount of surface water used vs Crop Yield(Eg. Soyabeans in Bushel) B.) Amount of Ground Water Used vs Crop Yield(Eg. Soyabeans in Bushel) C.) Amount of Irrigated Water Applied vs Crop Yield(Eg. Soyabeans in Bushel) D.) Amount of planted Acres etc... From this graph Visualisation statistical Analysis, Farmer can be able to know the quantity of water (Eg.Ground,Surface,Irrigated) needed and amount of crops that can be produce with it with respect to time(Eg. year 2006,2002,2000,1999). For instance in Nebraska state in the year 2006, the average Arms Datasets were as follows Ground Water Used: 90.472 Percent of Irrigated Acres. Surface Water Used: 9.528 Percent of Irrigated Acres. Water Used Per Irrigated Acres: 9.715 Per Inches. Irrigated Acres: 2369.147 Per 1,000 Acres. Planted Acres: 5050.109 Per 1,000 Acres. Crop Yield Per Irrgated Acres: 61.98 Pounds(cotton), Bushels(all other crops). All this statistical Data will help Farmers in decision making process like checking production cost, crops yield and Business Profitability The app also provides Dataset Graphs Visualisation Components that allows Farmers to Compare and visualize data at State Levelon the amount of planted Acres per state, the amount of Water needed(Eg Irrigated, Surface and Ground Water) versus Crop Yield etc per state. This will help USA Farmers to know the States that consumes more water and amount of crop yields(eg. Soyabeans). For instance, graphs data visualisation on state level comparison eg in year 2006, shows that INDIANA consumes highest Groundwater(about 100.00 percent of irrigated acres and crop yields was 40.561 Bushels) while NEBRASKA consumes lesser Groundwater(90.472 percent of irrigated acres and yield the highest crop in the year about 61.98 Bushels) Based on Production Cost,You can see that Nebraska in the year 2006(ARMS DataSets) consumes lesser water and produces the highest Crop Yields(Eg. Soyabeans) than its counter part state Indiana that consumes the highest water in the same year but produces a lesser Crop Yields. The Inference from this Arms dataset 2006 makes Nebraska one of the best state in USA suitable for Soyabeans Farming both in production cost and crop Yields. Components B: Social Network Integration with 1-to-1 Chat System with Photo Sharing Option My Interview with Farmers, Professors and all Agriculttural Students and graduates in various Universities Points out that If USDA Dataset can be collabrated with Social Network for purpose of Dataset Analysis, Data Visualisation, information Exchange(Just like in Facebook),it will make farming/Agricultural Studies one of the most interesting discipline in the world. For Instance a Young Graduate trying to setup a Soyabeans Farming can immediately leverage USDA Datasets and can share his knowledge, ideas or issues with other Users(Farmers) via a social network thus ensuring information propagation through an unbroken succession from one generation of Farmer to another. This Social Integration are design to function just like facebook. it will help farmers exchange informations between themselves. Farmers, Agriculturist can be able to Share and post status updates, post photos, post and Share Videos, send like \u0026 comments etc. about Agricultural modern trends and for educative puposes. Farmers can be able to send friend request to their fellow Farmers, Makes friends and chat with one another on 1-to-1 chat conversations with photo sharing options. Users can be able to search Farmers based on their names,email address, phone number and Farmers farming specialization. For instance if you are looking for a farmer that speacialized on Corn Farming to have a conversation with him or her, you can just type corn in the search box and all farmers that specialized on corn farming will be populated..... If you know how to use facebook, this social integration will be easy for you as everything were implemented using facebooklike technology and user friendly UI designs. How it Works Just call up the application and make one time registration. Login to start accessing the app. To visualize USDA Datasets, click on AGRO PRODUCT, select soyabeans as a case study and then navigate. On the landing page, you can be able to access the USDA Datasets on different states overtime eg(year 2006,2002,2000,1999), If the states you are looking for is not loaded, Click on LOAD MORE US STATE button to load more state. Every Populated states immediately shows average Planted Acres, ground water used,surface water used, irrigated water applied and amount of crop yield over time. To be able to visualize datasets statistics of a particular state eg ARKANSAS,NEBRASKA etc... you can click on Click on View State Statistics To be able to compare datasets statistics for all states at state level, click on Compare All States flanking each state. Once you are there first select the year eg (2006,2002,2000,1999) that you want to compare and visualized, and the graphs data will be loaded for each year choosen. For further details reference the demonstration video or email me. For Social integration, everybody is already facebook fans, so just assume yourself to be accessing facebooks where you can post Status Updates, Post Photos, Post and Share Videos on Farming and Agro-Educations. Can Send Friend request, Makes friends, Like and Comments on every post being Shared, can search and connect to any Farmer in United States. Among all can be able to Chat with other Farmers in United States on 1-to-1 chat messages with photo sharing option.. Challenges I faced Some Datasets has null values when making API Call to USDA ARMS DATASETs. NUll simply means that the value in Undetermined, unknown or Not available. I implore a module on my server backend that converts all null values in the API to zero to make statistical analysis more efficient. Again Building a Social Network with Facebook design with all techonogical components and features to make the app user friendly and integrating it with USDA DATASETS for Data Analysis and Visualization took much of my time to be precise(32 days) What Next We will adding other remaining crops and its datasets one after the other via the API call and allows data Visualisation on the fly while ensuring that all datasets are in place. we need to expand social aspect of the Apps to allow farmers to start creating Farmers Groups, Farmers Page just like in facebook. Eg A farmer can create a group on titled \"Rice Farming\" and other farmers who are interested on Rice farming can follow up. Comming Soon Android Version in less than 14 days. IOS and Windows version can be coded in less than 30 days if there is a need for it . All resources is just set for coding. Technology Upgrade coming soon...... 1.) Using Memcache to offload load on the database. 2.) Presently the Chat system works on Long connection polling and server sent Events.

On this, o\u0027 so very gorgeous, day you spot this handsome fisherman pulling in plenty of fish on his little tugboat - and you think to yourself: \"Hey! I might want to keep some souvenir for later\". So you snap your picture.. and our handy little Application reminds you: \"You are in a Marina Protected Area\". It comes to mind! You should not fish here! But there is this handsome fisherman raking in all that protected fish! Situations like this happen often and more frequent than we would like all over the world. We made it our mission to battle this. With the single snap of a picture with the cellphone of your choice, your expensive DSLR or that really bad Point and Shoot you found in your sofa last week - it\u0027s in your hands. to report illegal fishing all over the place - and especially in those protected natural habitats. We are leveraging the power of GPS Location, Time and some handy \"little\" Network called AIS. AIS is the go-to Communication Channel for all kinds of commercial ship movement. We are able to link up your pictures information, with whatever boat is around you and catch the fisher in-situ and with photo evidence - all you need to do, is snap that picture! We are FisHarmony, not Tinder for Fish -- In all seriousness, IUU is a big problem. We try to tackle this problem with CrowdSources Data. We created our own algorithm that allows us to group and track the incoming reports, and make it easier for Users to see what’s going on out on the water.

We saw an opportunity to make that knowledge much more useful by building search that\u0027s super-fast and a little personalised. What it does Thunkfluence is a Chrome extension that indexes your Confluence content in your browser and then provides a lightning fast as-you-type search. Instant results make it really easy to refine queries on the fly to locate a page you\u0027re looking for, or explore what other people have contributed. Thunkfluence knows who wrote what and finds people as well as pages. Results include a few authorities who have authored the most content relevant to your query. So if you can\u0027t find the knowledge you\u0027re looking for, you know exactly who to ask – super useful. Finally, Thunkfluence keeps track of the pages you work with and keeps them just one click away. When someone else updates your pages, you\u0027ll see right away. How we built it Thunkfluence is a pure Chrome extension. There\u0027s no server or back-end so all the data stays on your computer. This design is naturally secure, an innovative alternative to other third-party enterprise search engines. Thanks to the Confluence REST API, we didn\u0027t need a Confluence server add-on either, so it works out of the box for both Cloud and Server without your Confluence administrator doing anything. Challenges we ran into Some people have a lot of content in Confluence, so indexing it all in browser can be a bit of a resource hog. We\u0027ve found a balance by indexing most of the recent data, and checking with Confluence for any extra matches (via API). Unfortunately Chrome extensions don\u0027t have very fine-grained permissions, so even though Thunkfluence is pretty secure because it\u0027s all on your computer, we have to ask for more permissions than we need in order to get the smoothest user experience. None of your data goes anywhere, though. Accomplishments that we\u0027re proud of Indexing in your browser is a novel idea and we\u0027re proud of the result. We had to do some complex plumbing between the pop-up UI and a background page to get everything as fast as possible, but it was worth it. We’re also proud of improving relevance of search results by making them more personalised. It’s still basic, but we’re excited about the possibilities of a personalised index built just for you. What we learned We learned that Chrome extensions are pretty powerful, and a lot more could be done. The natural speed and security from doing things in the browser are really neat. What\u0027s next for Thunkfluence We\u0027re still working on making Thunkfluence even more personalised, surfacing relevant pages that other people have created, and increasing personal relevance of search results. Because Thunk runs in your browser, we can build an index that\u0027s best for you.

{"likes":29,"hackathon":"Hsuehshan Tunnel Transformer","winner":false,"name":"AVGS (Active Vision Guiding System)","blurp":"Drive with active light guide for best speed and safe distance in tunnel","description":"Inspiration Hsuehshan Tunnel is the best road for connecting Taipei and Yilan. However there is always traffic jams which increases the driving time on holidays. This proposal focus on eliminating the factor of traffic jam to solve the problem. From our experience of getting stuck in traffic jam, the car speed is usually slow when entering a tunnel, and gets higher and higher when approaching the exit. Why? There are three main reasons we have concluded as follow: People can’t always keep driving at the same high speed because of the difference speed information showing on the dashboard between different cars. People have difference concepts of safe distance for driving. Improper brake slows down the car speed behind and causes the chain reaction. That is, if all the drivers can drive at the best speed with a suitable safe distance, the rate of traffic flow in tunnel can be higher. As a result, how to guide drivers respectively to drive at the best speed with an appropriate distance is the main purpose of the proposal. 雪山隧道是目前台北與宜蘭往返中，最便捷安全的路線。然而，此路線在假日常常造成堵塞的問題，使得行車時間大為增加。本提案提出一種可行且有效率的方式，根除造成堵塞的因素，解決雪山隧道塞車的問題。 從我們自身的塞車經驗觀察到，通常進入雪山隧道時的車速很慢，但漸漸靠近出口時，速度越來越通順。探究其主要原因，是車輛沒有保持最高速度前進、或者不當的剎車動作，造成後方連鎖反應。因此，如能讓所有車輛在安全前提之下，能保持最佳的前進速度，隧道的車流量可以達到最理想的狀況。 然而，最困難之處在於每輛車儀表顯示的車速會有落差，加上每位駕駛主觀認為的安全車距皆不同，因此如何導引每位駕駛至最佳的\"車速\"與\"車距\"，是本提案最主要的目標。 What it does Considering the expanding ability of equipment for cars and the adaptability of new technology for drivers, it is not easy to build a new system on cars. For example, it is inconvenience to update old vehicles or make all the drivers learn new technology devices or new APPs. The efficiency will be decrease much if not every driver take part in the system. Considering the compatibility for all the vehicles and drivers, and also the driving environments of tunnels are simpler than those of other road types. We design a simple vision guiding system which is able to be installed in the tunnel. This system can provide clear information to guide all the cars moving at the best speed with appropriate safe distance between vehicles. It is the best solution we think! We call it \"AVGS” (Active Vision Guiding System) 考慮到車輛的設備擴充能力，以及駕駛人對於科技方式輔助的適應能力，直接建構在車輛上的控制方法是較為不易的。例如，老舊車輛可能有升級擴充的困難，或者部分駕駛人不習慣使用新的科技配備、手機APP等，若無法使所有駕駛人都參與紓解塞車的系統，效率會大打折扣。 考量到車輛與大眾駕駛人的相容性，且隧道相較於普通道路，是單方向、不可隨意變換車道，相對單純的環境，我們提出一種可建構於隧道本身的視覺導引系統，直接在隧道增加一個簡單直覺的駕駛導引方式，讓每位駕駛可自然的參考視覺指示，維持在最佳的車速和車距狀態，我們稱為主動式視覺導引系統\"AVGS (Active Vision Guiding System)\"。 How I built it First of all, we set sensors along the tunnel. The sensor can be IR, light sensor, radar, supersonic or others which can detect the passing vehicles. Second, we set LED array on the road. Lastly, a host computer calculates the car speed depend on the sensor signals and drives the corresponding LED array. The LED array can be a vision symbol, indicating the drivers respectively and reminding them of making some adjustments if they need. The LED indication will move with vehicles and change types depend on the driving condition: Green arrow - You are moving at the best speed (90~100km/h) with an appropriate safe distance (E.G.30~50m) range. Twinkle Green arrow – The speed is too slow, please speed up. Red arrow – The speed is too high, or safe distance is too short, please slow down. PS: the ideal speed and safe distance range can be modified by control center. 首先，將感測器(可以是雷射/IR/磁感/光敏電阻/超音波...)裝設於隧道沿線中，藉以偵測移動的車輛。其次，於路面中間沿線鋪設LED符號，最後，利用上位的電腦或PLC裝置，根據回授訊號，即時推算出每台車輛的速度與距離，並驅動對應的LED陣列。LED陣列為一個視覺指示符號，並且各別地指引駕駛，若駕駛行為需要做調整時給予提醒。 這些LED將會隨著車輛移動，並根據不同的駕駛行為給予不同指示: 車輛在最佳移動時速(如90~100km/h)與車距範圍(如30~50m)內，保持恆亮綠色箭頭。 若車速過慢，綠色箭頭會持續閃爍提醒駕駛人加速，直到正確車速後恢復恆亮綠色箭頭。 若車距過近或超速，箭頭顏色會變成紅色閃爍提醒修正，直到正確車速後恢復恆亮綠色箭頭。 PS:行控中心可依照當下路況動態調整各種參數範圍。 Challenges I ran into Since installing the system in tunnel will use lots of sensors and LEDs, it is an important consideration to decrease the cost with reasonable effectiveness. At first, we have evaluated and tried various kinds of sensor, some cost high and some need more time to develop. Lastly, we think the photo sensor is a relatively low-cost and good functionality choice. In practical application, the response time of sensor must be considered to be able to precisely detect the car speed which is over 100km/hr. Because of the large amount of LEDs, it is necessary to select reliable drivers to keep the constant lamination and stable. Moreover, the system has to deal with a lot of information of moving cars, so the hardware core needs good ability of parallel computing such as CUDA. It is also a good way to use multi control units to handle some information respectively, and the host computer or control center will communicate with these control units to monitor the whole tunnel. 因需鋪設許多感應器與LED，如何降低成本又能達到效用是很重要的考量點。起初，我們評估、嘗試了很多種不同的感測器，不是成本高就是開發時程較長，最後我們實測發現，光感測器的方式是相對成本較低，但又保有功能性的好方案。實際裝設時感應器的種類選擇很重要，反應時間需考慮近百公里的車速。 由於隧道中的LED數量龐大，硬體需要搭配可靠的驅動器，以維持恆定亮度，並提升穩定度。此外，因為須同時處理大量車輛移動的資訊，核心控制硬體需要較強的平行運算能力，可使用CUDA架構，或者使用多個區域控制核心進行運算，最上位的監控電腦或行控中心蒐集所有資訊後，再進行全隧道的監控。 Accomplishments that I\u0027m proud of It is a very simple and clear way (vision guiding system) to solve the traffic jam problem in the tunnel. 這是一個非常單純且簡潔的方案(視覺導引)解決隧道內塞車的原因。 The system can be built in tunnel directly, so it\u0027s compatible with all vehicles and drivers. No need to learn or update any equipment. 系統直接建構於隧道本身，設計與運作環境單純，不需要駕駛學習操作且通用於所有車輛。 Provide sufficient messages to each car, minimize the factor of traffic jams. 針對個別車輛的問題給予個別指示，將塞車的可能因子降到最低程度。 We have designed the software in C, and the control logic is able to be transplanted to larger real system in tunnel with little modification. 我們用C完成了軟體設計，控制邏輯僅需部分微調，是可以移植到真實的隧道系統中。 What I learned To find out the effectiveness of the system installing in tunnel, we have driven to the tunnel many times. We believe the LED icon should be placed on a noticeable position without distracting the drivers. The best location is the front ground of driver. That can make driver not only concentrate on the driving situation but also notice the LED icon. 為了得知系統放置於隧道中的效果，多次開車進入隧道，我們認為視覺導引圖示出現的位置需要在明顯但不容易使駕駛分心的視線方向，最佳位置為正前方稍遠地面，讓駕駛在專注前方車輛與路況時同時可以感知到提醒。 The type of LED icon was discussed and modified several times to make drivers understand quickly and easily. 視覺提醒的種類，經過多次討論將數量降到最少變化且使用清晰易懂的設計。 There are many types of sensors, considering the cost, response time and developing time after some tests, finally we choose the best solution so far - photo sensor. The photo sensors can be applied in real tunnels. 感測器的種類繁多，經過多方嘗試後，考量到成本、反應時間、開發時程等等因素，選擇目前最佳的方案-光感測器!此感測器可實際應用於真實隧道中。 What\u0027s next Different types of vehicle would activate different numbers of sensors, the software have to take it into consideration. 不同車種的長度將會遮蔽不同數量的感應器，背後程式需要可以判斷差異 There are lots of dynamic data updating at the same time, so the reliability verification of software and hardware design is required. 實際隧道內會同時產生大量動態數據，軟硬體設計與運作可靠度需要驗證 How to transplant the prototype to the real application in tunnel? A PLC or an industrial computer can be used as the control center instead of the ARM microprocessor. By using communication way like RS485 or Ethernet, the control center controls the LED drivers and local control units which sense the sensor signal and calculate the car speed. 未來將如何移植原型系統至隧道的應用之中呢? 可以使用可程式邏輯控制器或工業電腦取代原型中的ARM微處理器。藉由通訊如RS485或者Ethernet的方式，行控中心控制LED驅動器以及下位的控制單元，這些控制單元將各自處理部分的感測器訊號並計算車速。 In the future, the AVGS system can be implemented with big data based on the traffic information over the years. According to the current time, car quantity or other factors, establish an algorithm to calculate the best traffic flow in the tunnel and give a best car speed command to control center or host computer. That way, the effectiveness of the proposed AVGS can be the best. 未來將可與大數據做結合，由數年來的交通資訊，根據目前的時間、車輛數等各種因子，建立出即時隧道的最佳車流量的演算法，下達最佳的車速命令給行控中心，將可以將系統的效能提至最高 For real application, the installing location of LED is flexible depending on the professional study of user interface and difficulties of construction.實際隧道內系統燈號安裝位置可以經由更專業的使用者介面研究與施工可行性判斷後微調。 Working sample Demo Since the actual system installed in tunnel will be too large, instead we develop a small prototype system with the same control logic function. We use 15 LED array to arrange red arrows and green arrows. The sensor we choose is photo sensor which is really cheap and effective. Each sensor is put next to each LED arrow, and it will be triggered when the light is covered by the passing car. Besides, we also design hardware including the driving circuit for LED and interface circuit for sensors. The control unit we use is ST Microelectronics STM32F3 discovery board with ARM Cortex-M4 CPU, and it is developed in C language. The system structure is as the following diagram. This prototype can truly accomplish all the functions of this proposal, and also simulate the control center to change the car speed command by using the knob. Please refer to the introduction video. 因為實際架設於隧道中的硬體會過於龐大，取而代之地，我們開發了一套縮小尺度的原型系統，但有著相同控制邏輯功能。LED使用雙色形式，排列出紅色及綠色箭頭，總共15組，感測器選擇光感應的方式，此方式既省成本又有不錯的功效，放置於每一個LED箭頭旁，車輛經過感測器會遮住外界的光源，藉以觸發訊號。同時設計LED驅動及感測周邊介面電路，主控台使用ST Microelectronics的STM32F3 discovery board，核心處理器為ARM Cortex-M4，使用C語言進行開發。系統架構如下圖，此模型除了可確實達到本提案的所有功能之外，也可用旋鈕模擬行控中心改變行車速度命令，請見介紹影片。 System Structure Hardware: STM32F3 discovery board and DM134 LED Driver LED and light sensor Road Test!(Green car-Standard Speed; Grey car-Too short safe distance) Built With stm32f3-discovery-board dm134-led-driver c","technologies":["c"],"authors":["Yen-Pin Kao","Ching Chen Liao","Dengmo Peng","Dennis Peng"]},

Inside a futuristic command center, a virtual holographic display allows commanders like you to finally see through the fog of war. Build swarms of gunships, tanks, bombers, and other units, and use them to strategically outmaneuver the enemy. With a perfect close-up view of the battlefield, there are no excuses left. All that counts is the tactical skill of the commander. Controls Tactera is controlled entirely through the player’s gaze and the Gear VR touchpad. The basic interaction is to select a base (by looking at it and tapping) and then select a destination to deploy troops. The player can also customize the composition of their army through a simple floating UI. Note: The game includes a minimal tutorial, which is reset every time the application is restarted. Mechanics Although Tactera is an RTS in most respects, it simplifies or breaks many genre conventions in order to optimize the gameplay for VR. The usual elements of base control and resource collection are present, but they’re mostly automated so that the player can focus on other tactical concerns. One of the big strategic decisions is the composition of the player’s army. There are several different units in the game, each of which has unique strengths and weaknesses, but the player must choose a set of 3 to use in each individual battle. On top of that, each of the player’s bases can only build one of those types, forcing the player to prioritize unit types on-the-fly. Once the units are built, the player must continually choose when and where to deploy them. Units can be sent anywhere on the battlefield, but the player has to outmaneuver the enemy by choosing whether to cluster forces or spread them out, whether to attack or defend, and where to direct artillery and bomber strikes. Innovation Tactera is specifically designed for the Gear VR: Using a tabletop perspective allows the game to easily direct player attention, remove the need for locomotion, exploit 3D effects to the fullest, and maintain an immersive fictional context. The RTS formula has been remixed to allow for tactical gameplay that fits the strengths and limitations of the Gear VR. The result is a game with a shorter play session and with no need for complex camera controls, hotkeys, control groups, selection boxes, or other encumbrances. There are specialized VR settings on the options page, allowing players to adjust the camera height (so they can play either sitting or standing) and to adjust the power of the 3D effect (to monoscopic, full 3D, or in between). This can be used to reduce potential motion sickness caused by the lack of positional tracking. The player’s units give frequent radio reports via stereo-positioned sound effects, using audio to point the player’s attention in the right direction. The game’s UI is optimized for VR, with large text, a depth-sensitive crosshair, and UI interactions specifically designed for a tabletop format.

{"likes":33,"hackathon":"Meteor Global Distributed Hackathon","winner":false,"name":"If-Found-Lost","blurp":"No need to write your contact information on the things that can be lost or misplaced again.","description":"Inspiration Here is how I got the idea. I once forgot my laptop charger at the library in University. It took me 3 days to find it at the end, because there is no way to contact me, for a person who finds it. I could have written my name, mobile number and contact information on it, but it is embarrassing because every sees it. So I thought how can I solve this problem and are there any existing one. I could find that there isn\u0027t any existing solution. So I focused on it. What I need is something everybody can easily see, but cannot contact me or bug me throw it. I think it may look like a encryption problem too. I alway enjoyed compiling innovating solutions to problems, so I got a solution and here we are. What it does When a user create an account in If-Found-Lost.com he get a globally unique numeric id which is short to be easily rememberable and writable. So if the id is 7766 it makes a URL, www.If-Found-Lost.com/7766. So instead of private contact information this is what he writes or prints on his items. For example he can write it in his books, in the keytag of his backpack or in his quadcopter. The name If-Found-Lost is there to make the intuition that what should you do \"if you found this lost\". So lets say Ann found my charger so she just has to go to that link and need to enter the best way to contact her as it asks. She does not need any login or create an account, just to go trough a captcha. Then I will get the message right away to my inbox in If-Found-Lost, saying Ann has found this and this is the way to contact her. So I am the one who decides whether to contact her or not. So I am directly contacting Ann and getting it, and I did not expose my privacy details to the public. Here is another thing, I thought how to expand this as a business. For an unique id given by the website, we\u0027l say it as IFL(stands for If-Found-Lost id). So If my packpack or music player coming with an IFL built-in, I do not have to write my id on it. Just as we login to warantee information, after buying that item we go to If-Found-Lost.com and link that IFL with our account. This gives manufactures a competitve advantage, becuae lets say switss gear is joining with us and with every backPack it comes with a uniqueID printed and it makes their backPacks globally findable without exposing the privacy of the owner. How I built it I am using MeteorJS and mongoDB for databases. Using semantic-ui to give it a nice look and some fast rendering. Using google recaptcha for authentications where it does not need to sign in. Created the website to look and feel simple as possible which makes users happy. Challenges I ran into I had to build this on my own without teammates, because we are having an exam tomorrow and everybody is busy with that. So I worked straight 24 hours to implement this. Meteor makes is great and most importantly fun to develop. I was familiar with C++ and Java before, so this was a real fun to do. It took me time to make videos and stuff because I did all individually in a limited time. But the hackathon was one hell of a fun. Accomplishments that I\u0027m proud of If-Found-Lost is now a fully working product. Currently serving at if-found-lost.meteor.com. This is an idea that I had me for few months, So I am proud that I could finally implement it, and get support to run a possible innovative business with it in the future. What I learned I leaned the insight of how Meteor work, the things that I haven\u0027t know and this is awesome. What\u0027s next for If-Found-Lost The site is currently serving at If-Found-Lost.meteor.com, so first next thing is to serve it on a separate server for If-Found-Lost.com.

I\u0027ve been to Niagara Falls no less than 7 times so far; however, the only experience that I remember from those 7 is the time when I went with a mutual friend who is a native of Niagara Falls. He offered me different vantage points that truly made this 7th trip to Niagara Falls the most memorable. Why not make your first trip just as memorable? What it does TourUs is a crowdsourcing platform that matches the interests and potential locations of tourists to various tourguides who are knowledgeable about a particular location. We have a custom matching algorithm that creates a \"score\" based on the number of mutual interests between a tourist and tourguide and returns these results back to the tourist. The tourist can then view the profile of a tourguide to judge whether or not he/she would be a good fit for them. Even if the tourist doesn\u0027t wish to contact the tourguide, they can even view the list of reccommended events, places, or experiences to adventure at a certain location. They can then decide when/where they want to meet up, if they decide to do so, and the tourguide can be tipped by the tourist. How We built it Our entire tech stack revolves around meteor.js which combines client and server side code into a single easy to deploy system. Meteor uses MongoDB for the database, and a templating language of HTML5 for the frontend. Much of the dynamic client interfacing and backend interfacing is written in javascript. Challenges We ran into Before this hackathon 36 hours ago, none of us had ever touched Meteor.js or had extensive experience with javascript. As a result, writing much of the client and server side turned out to be a larger learning curve than we had imagined. In addition, MongoDB which was very different from the SQL databases we were accustomed to using was hard to understand due to its dynamic schema. We also had to understand the concept of reactivity with respect to Meteor.js. We were also about 6 hours late to the hackathon, which was a bit crippling in terms of time management; we found ourselves a bit rushed at the end, but managed to pull it together!

GAMEPLAY Surrounded by banks of monitors, trinkets and gizmos, the player must track down a suspected criminal(s) before they commit the crime predicted by his/her A.I. At the moment the A.I. predicts a crime, the player is given the last 20 minutes of data collect by security equipment to scrub through for clues as to who, where and how the crime will be committed. A shift ends when, either the criminal(s) are neutralized, or time runs out and the predicted event occurs. The main resource is time. Every investigation (or move) the player makes, puts criminals once step closer to committing said crime. “Where in the World is Carmen Sandiago”, “Papers Please”, “Clue” and \"Five Nights at Freddie\u0027s\" are all inspirations. We\u0027ve added elements of scrubbable timelines, CCTV footage, sensor data, and tough moral decisions. Sample gameplay video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dAU2KYT5F3E0 CONTROLS This is a touchpad only game. The player is stationary and seated at his security terminal. They can tap to select UI elements or swipe to scrub through security footage and radio stations. GAME MECHANICS Core gameplay consists of looking for clues in security frames. Clues lead the player to different areas or to the identity of suspects. When suspects are identified, the player issues a warrant and dispatches a drone to \"deal with\" the individuals. The player is rewarded or docked credits based on her/his performance and the outcome of the predicted crime. Credits can be used to buy visual upgrades and \"power-ups\". INNOVATION With multiple VR titles under our belts, our team has learned what works and what doesn\u0027t in VR. Attention has been spent to ensure a comfortable and accessible experience. We\u0027ve concentrated our efforts on maximizing the use of the controls offered by the Gear VR hardware. Swipe, tap and gaze. Attention to detail in the environment is key for an immersive VR experience. Dust motes drift through the scenes, a fly buzzes in the corner and CRT monitors glow and flicker. We have tried to make this feel like a believable world. The use of fully animated photoscanned NPC\u0027s is innovative not only for VR, but for gaming in general. Our characters have realistic social animations. They will look into your eyes, their pupils dilate, and the shift attention to other points of interest in the environment. Things like microsaccades and motion captured animation add to their believably. UI is very VR friendly. Text is kept as large and clean as possible for readability. Interesting objects are kept at arms length to prevent the player from leaning in for a closer look without positional tracking. We\u0027re using a unique technique to correct for the \"black smearing\" effect produced by high contrast blacks on OLED screens.

{"likes":27,"hackathon":"Meteor Global Distributed Hackathon","winner":false,"name":"The Meteor Train","blurp":"A toy train, controlled by a Raspberry Pi, running Meteor for the UI.","description":"Inspiration Playing with trains is fun. Coding with Meteor is also fun. So, why not control a toy train through the browser using Meteor? What it does The Meteor Train is a toy train, controlled by a Meteor application. After booting the Raspberry and starting the Meteor application, you can connect to the UI using ip-adress:3000. If no one else is in charge of controlling the engine, you can take control of the train. Sliders allow you to set the driving direction and the desired speed. A big speed-indicator shows the current speed. Other visitors of the application are considered as passenger, which are carried by the train, probably waiting for the chance to take over the engine. The count of the passengers is also shown in the cockpit. How we built it The project consists of several parts: Hardware A Playmobil toy train A Raspberry Pi 2 An H-bridge to control the motor of the train A 12V NiMH battery pack A step-down voltage regulator to provide the 5V for Raspberry Pi A WLAN adapter for the Raspberry Software Meteor running on the Raspberry node-wiringpi to access the GPIO pins from Node.js A toy railroad engine from Playmobil was taken to start from. It provides the chassis and the motor. One team member created all the hardware stuff, soldered the H-bridge as well as other interfaces to the existing railroad engine. He had to drill holes in the plastic chassis for the cables and provide tons of experience to solve the voltage issues. In the meantime, a second team member took care of the Meteor application, which provides the user interface as well as a logic to allow only one engineer at the same time. The third team member was responsible for installing Meteor and the application on the Raspberry Pi hardware. He implemented the engine control, the control of the lights and parts of the UI. Challenges we ran into The first H-bridge (SN754410 Quadruple Half-H Driver) wasn\u0027t suitable for the planned operating voltage of 5V. So we had to change to another one: L6203 DMOS Full Bridge Driver. Furthermore, we changed the motor voltage to 12V. Furthermore, we found out that developing for different Meteor versions is nearly impossible. Accomplishments that we\u0027re proud of We\u0027re proud of implementing all the stuff within the 24 hours, even we suffered several setbacks. We\u0027re happy that especially the hardware part was so well prepared that we could resolve the issues. We saw smoking electronic parts, but luckily they still work. And we really like the speed indicator. What we learned Use a boilerplate, only if you need the features within First, we chose Base to start the project, but it contained so much stuff, that we actually don\u0027t need. So, we got back to simple Meteor templates. Use the same Meteor version on all devices We started with an older Meteor version (\u003c 1.2) on the Raspberry Pi, but the desktop PCs were already updated. After struggling around with the different versions, we decided to update Node and Meteor on the Raspberry Pi – thanks to Nodesource and Meteor Universal it took less than the suspected five hours (on the Raspberry Pi 2). Have a second hardware option available It\u0027s easy to change a software decision during such a hackathon, but having a second option regarding the hardware really saved the project for us. Even careful reading the data sheets before ordering the parts didn\u0027t prevent us from using a non-suitable component in the first run. What\u0027s next for The Meteor Train A camera showing the actual view from the driver\u0027s seat would be fine, as well as playing the engine sounds – we already bought a USB sound card for this reason.

The game challenges players\u0027 ability to respond quickly and also offers a fully immersed first person perspective when controlling the character to zoom past obstacles and solve puzzles. We have also maximized the use of Gear VR\u0027s touchpad in gameplay. You can use both touchpad and gamepad to play our game. In the demo version, 2-3 game stages have been developed up until now, while in the full version there will be much more funny elements, puzzles, stages, and new challenging gameplay. It supposes to take at least 3 months for the final release. Milestone II Update: Recently,we have settled the game mechanics of Finding and most of the game elements.Also,we have tried some different types of art style. We have made great progress in using Gear VR’s touchpad to control the character in our game.You can walk around freely,launch your claw to grab these Photospheres and swing yourself though different floating islands like the Spider Man,and activate some special devices and props in the world of Finding.We can put most of the game play that a traditional platform adventure game needs in Finding. The game begins in a fantastic world that seems like being destroyed.There’s no continent in this world,the fragmented ground and huge stones are floating in the sky.The world is quite unstable,There are a lot of portals in this world that will transport you from normal world to alternate realities.Also we have some of special devices to make illusions into realities.Our character need to find what happened to this world.We even designed some Titans as a boss in the end of each chapter.Hopefully we have enough time to finish all those contents before the last deadline. After we tried some different types of art style in Gear VR,we made a lot of compromises.We can not use any camera based image effect to promote the visual performance of our game.We always  hesitated between the details of the world and the limitation of draw calls.So,we are still trying to find a best way to achieve good visual performance in Gear VR. Now we have already finished two game stages and one tutorial stage.Last week we show our first game stage to some random people.Most of them love the new VR game experience.So,Keep on fighting!

{"likes":22,"hackathon":"Atlassian Codegeist: Add-on Hackathon","winner":false,"name":"Limbr Reports for JIRA Cloud","blurp":"Slice and dice your data with powerful custom reports, directly within JIRA - no spreadsheets required","description":"Inspiration Through my consulting practice, Limbr, I help software and marketing teams become more efficient and more effective through the application of lean and agile methods. I implement the Atlassian Cloud stack (JIRA Software, Tempo Timesheets, Confluence, BitBucket, HipChat) for each of my clients, customized with a set of battle-tested conventions and configurations that I\u0027ve honed over the last 5 years. While the setup works well overall, I have always found that the reporting capabilities left a little to be desired - far too frequently, a client asks me \"how do I find out... \", and my best answer has been \"run such and such JQL query, export the data to Excel, and manipulate the spreadsheet this way and that way\". This works, but presents a real hassle for users for simple ad-hoc reporting needs. For example, say I want to know the average velocity of one of my Scrum teams over the past eight sprints. I could either run the Velocity Report included in JIRA Software and break out my calculator to manually sum and average the shipped Story Points, or I could run a JQL query to filter for the relevant issues, export to CSV, and add aggregation functions to the spreadsheet. Furthermore, I want to calculate this figure before every sprint planning session in order to inform the team\u0027s commitment for the upcoming sprint. What a pain! I thought there must be a better way, and searched for viable solutions in the Marketplace. Unfortunately, while there were several reporting and business intelligence add-ons available for JIRA Cloud, they were all predicated on exporting JIRA data to an external BI tool. These tools are no doubt powerful, however needing to leave JIRA to perform basic segmentation or aggregation was exactly what I wanted to avoid. Additionally, I needed a solution that was both accessible and intuitive to grasp for a wide range of JIRA users, which was at odds with the requirement of buying and learning a sophisticated external tool. Thus, Limbr Reports for JIRA Cloud was born. What it does Limbr Reports essentially bolts a reporting engine directly into the JIRA user interface. Users can easily create a report, and then customize the presentation with a variety of configuration options. Each report sources issue data from a base query, constructed with JQL. The user decides how to slice and dice the data, sorting and grouping with unrestricted levels of nesting. Additionally, the user can configure aggregations (sum, average, minimum and maximum) on supported field types (numbers and dates, initially), and the report will calculate these aggregations at runtime and summarize the data at the report and group level. How I built it The add-on was built with the 3REE stack - React, Redux, RethinkDB and Express. The reporting engine runs completely on the client-side, and uses React for the views and Redux for managing application state. The client fetches report data directly from JIRA using Atlassian Connect\u0027s AP library. To ensure that the client complied with Atlassian Design Guidelines, I ported a good chunk of the Atlassian UI library to reusable React components. I hope to further polish this library and release it open-source it in the future for the benefit of other add-on developers. The client needs to talk to the add-on backend in order to persist report configuration metadata. To accomplish this, I built a series of JSON API endpoints, exposed by Express and backed by RethinkDB. I leveraged Atlassian Connect Express to help with JWT auth, installation lifecycle, and a few other functions. The API runs on Heroku and the RethinkDB instance is hosted with Compose.io. Challenges I ran into Much of the technology stack I chose was new to me (I intentionally chose bleeding-edge), and the learning curve was pretty steep. This was my first exposure to server-side JavaScript, to functional style programming in general, and to Redux and RethinkDB. Attempting to learn and correctly apply sane architecture, idioms and best practices was demanding and often frustrating. I ran into numerous technical issues along the way, including the need to fork and modify both Atlassian Connect Express (improved compatibility with Express 4.x) and a storage adapter for RethinkDB (added authentication support). Technical challenges aside, the largest challenge I grappled with was deciding on the feature scope of my minimum viable product. I have a laundry list of features that I wanted to include in this first release, and found it painful but necessary to aggressively cut scope in order to make the hackathon deadline. Accomplishments that I\u0027m proud of My \"day job\" is technical consulting, and although I\u0027ve worked on and with software teams over the past eight years and write a bit of code here and there, I don\u0027t consider myself a developer. This was my most significant (by far) attempt at writing an app for commercial use, and I\u0027m frankly extremely satisfied that I was able to complete it unassisted and create something of value. Regardless of the eventual popularity of the add-on in the Marketplace, at minimum I now have a viable solution to a problem that, until now, my clients have faced daily. I consider that to be an success by any measure. What I learned I learned way too much to list - some of the major ones include: Discovering that I actually enjoy working with JS, after ES6/ES7, Babel and Webpack perform their magic First time working with Express and server-side JS in general First time working with RethinkDB and with a JSON document store in general First time working with Redux and Flux architecture in general First time applying functional-style techniques in earnest, influenced heavily by idiomatic Redux What\u0027s next for Limbr Reports I have a significant roadmap for Limbr Reports, including: User- and group-level access control for reports Better support for Agile custom fields and a handful of remaining system fields Support for other report data sources (e.g. worklogs, sprints, releases, projects, users) Configure advanced filters, over and above JQL filtering capabilities Segmentation by custom buckets Calculated columns (e.g. display a column that sums the values from two other columns) Scheduled report delivery (e.g. email a report out on a weekly basis) Export reports to PDF, HTML, CSV Data visualizations and charts Expose reports as dashboard gadgets ... and much, much more!

On Outpour, it is easy and encouraged for you to tell your best friend that he is amazing, your coworker that she rocks, and your hero that she’s changed your life. We are getting more people to say more good things to each other – because people should know they are loved. The idea originated when Outpour’s creator anonymously wrote his friends frank, heartfelt emails explaining why he loved them. Many of his friends shared these emails with each other, and figured out that he wrote them. Because he wrote anonymously, with no expectation of reward, his messages created incredible joy out of thin air. Outpour lets anyone write that type of message. Outpour users do two things: First, write messages of gratitude. They can select people from a list of friends, search by username, or create profiles such as “My Favorite Barista.” Second, they can view messages written by and about their friends, as well as popular messages worldwide. We envision capturing, sharing, and celebrating every happy interaction between people. Kindness is usually a 1-to-1 interaction; we make it a 1-to-many. When someone is wonderful to you, it uplifts you both. Outpour reveals this wonderfulness so it uplifts many more.

Settings In this first episode, you embody Captain Clark, a ship captain in the 1800s, who has been attacked at sea by pirates. The ship’s crew has been decimated. Only the captain has been spared and has been taken prisoner on the pirates’ island. The pirates have gone back out to sea and the captain is now alone in a cage on the beach awaiting the pirates’ return. To survive, he will need to try to escape the island. The game The adventure takes place on the pirates’ island in the form of an open world. You can explore this tropical island by visiting about fifty places where you will have to scout out the terrain, collect and combine objects, and make progress in order to escape. The game uses a teleportation system to let the user move from place to place around the island. Details The game features an auto-save system that seamlessly saves your progress in the adventure. The user interface is reduced to a minimum to provide the most immersive experience possible. The game doesn’t require a gamepad to play. A gamepad can be used in place of the touchpad (Button 1 instead of tapping). The game is best experienced in a swivel chair (360° experience). It takes around 1 hour to complete the adventure (average time from playtest sessions).

And now with the advent of the world of IoT devices it has never been easier or more accessible to start such a project. However we don\u0027t all have the knowledge, experience or even desire to spend time and effort on building dashboards and tools to interact with our IoT devices, sensors and other hardware. So we wanted to provide a way for any IoT project to get set up with a quick web/mobile visualisation as easily as possible. What it does We have built a cloud based IoT platform which provides a fully customisable plug and play solution for makers and hackers to create dashboards and interaction tools for their hardware projects. Now anyone can build a web front end for their electronics project and see data being collected and displayed in real time thanks to the magic of Meteor. No longer will you need to learn about web development, frameworks and methodologies or spend money hiring other people with this knowledge to finish your IoT projects. With a flexible web front end widget based GUI tool anyone can build their own layer of data visualisation and manipulation to their clients and customers. In addition this app provides a great way to prototype, inspect and debug any and all kinds of data being collected from all types of IoT devices. How I built it We worked as team with each member focussing on their strengths and stronger areas of knowledge. We decided to write our code using as many of the newest features as possible with Meteor. This meant choosing Angular for the front end dashboards which now has excellent support in Meteor. In addition we made a conscious effort to write all code in as much of an \u0027es6/ecmascript2015\u0027 style as possible with the new support in the framework. For our first proof of concept we used a Particle (previously known as Spark) Core IoT device which was in turn connected up to a temperature sensor for real time data capture. The intention was to add more devices and sensors as quickly as possible. Our application design implemented a user flow for adding new devices to their accounts and profiles. Once a device and it\u0027s authentication details had been added to the platform our IoThingies application can immediately start querying this device for any methods, variables or data sets which may be available for collection and inspection. So in our first iteration we collected sensor temperature data using the Thermocouple connected to the Particle Core microprocessor.

Firstly our hardware IoT devices were not behaving very well when being connected to the cloud. This did delay our efforts on the hardware side at the start. Another challenge was to make sure that all the developer machines were up to date and could be used for development. As we had a mixture of operating systems this caused some issues. Finally the challenge of staying awake enough to try and develop as much of the application as possible was an obvious difficulty we did our best to cope with. Accomplishments that I\u0027m proud of At the end of the hackathon we had a working prototype of our app. We had some parts working in all areas of the application from the hardware IoT side to the Meteor server to the front end angular charting. We each overcame many difficulties to ensure this happened. What I learned We learned that there is always some preparation that can be done for a hackathon. This covers things like making sure all our machines are development ready as well as testing and knowing all our hardware devices and interfaces as best as possible so we can minimise the time spent learning during the hackathon. What\u0027s next for Internet of Thingies We hope to brainstorm further on how to take the Internet of Thingies to the next level and we will be trying to maybe get a working prototype out to test the market appetite for this product.

That is why with my colleagues we built a Graphical UI for Context.IO in Drupal to help anyone who can click their way through a configuration screen make their own email applications. Potential impact There are just under a 100 thousand users actively contributing to the Drupal project. With the Context.IO module it is now really easy for them to create email applications. We expect that the open sourced Context.IO module will have some or all of the following impact: Some of the sites that currently use Mailhandler will switch over to Context.IO Some of Drupal\u0027s 502 distributions (e.g. ticketing packages) will start including the Context.IO module into their downloadable package Site builders will start using the Context.IO module in their new projects Administrators will develop email applications for their organisations When you choose our submission for the competition you give us the funding to further promote it in the community. What it does Instead of making a single app, we wanted to create a platform on top of which other people, even non-developers could innovate. That\u0027s why we built a Drupal module that we\u0027ve open sourced. We\u0027ve also built an example implementation that uses the module to address 2 problems we had in our company. The Context.IO module lets you set up feeds in Drupal that will import emails, or data inside your emails into a site. To do so you don\u0027t need to write a single line of code. You can use our module to make applications that do any or a combination of the following: Import emails that fulfil certain criteria from your email archive Import emails as they arrive in your mailbox Extract information from email bodies (this currently requires regular expressions, I guess that qualifies as code) Share this information with a selected group of trusted parties that get access to your site Do certain actions (e.g. schedule, or send an email) when you receive an email that fulfils certain criteria Create users in your site every time you receive email from a new address, or when an email gets forwarded Drupal already has a module to import emails: Mailhandler. Drupal.org knows about 2,352 sites that currently use the module and it has been downloaded 62,105 times. The Context.IO module that we built however is superior over Mailhandler for the following reasons: Mailhandler doesn\u0027t provide options to search and filter emails Mailhandler\u0027s primary use case is to import mail as it arrives in a mailbox, not to process emails that have been archived. Mailhandler requires you to provide login credentials to the site, and can\u0027t currently request access using oAuth. As a result it\u0027s only really fit for single mailbox applications (e.g. a \"reply to\" comment on a forum). So not really for applications that consumers can grant access to their mailbox to. Drupal is one of the leading open source CMSs and is popular with a really large audience ranging from technically savvy consumers all the way through to enterprise organisations (e.g. https://www.whitehouse.gov/ runs on Drupal). While it is comparably easier to set up a Wordpress site, Drupal is more flexible. It\u0027s with this flexibility in mind that we built the Context.IO module. How we built it The module is conceived as a building block, compatible with Drupal\u0027s massive ecosystem of modules. Since it\u0027s a module that implements the Feeds architecture, it allows site builders to configure: A fetcher that uploads emails that fulfil a set of search parameters A parser that extracts information from inside the email into separate fields, to store structured information A processor that maps the information into native Drupal objects and their fields (e.g. nodes, users, comments) Challenges we ran into Overall the API was easy to use, but we had some difficulties with the implementation of the attachment API. We\u0027ve filed a bug for it on the GitHub project. In the beginning there were some synching issues with my inbox, because of which we couldn\u0027t fully test the body import function. Accomplishments that we are proud of We\u0027ve finished the Context.IO module in under 2 weeks. The site that we use in the demo video was built in less than 4 hours. The module is really powerful and plays nice with Drupal\u0027s contrib modules. We are really excited about it\u0027s potential. In 5 days we had 85 downloads for the module, and it\u0027s already reported in use on 3 sites. This is really fast adoption, that I haven\u0027t previously seen in my 10 year long Drupal carreer. What we learned We had a dependency bug with the Context.IO library and our developers had to freshen up their knowledge about dependency management with libraries in Drupal. Prototyping in Drupal goes really fast and is super fun (I guess that wasn\u0027t really news, for us at least) What\u0027s next for the Context.IO Drupal module We\u0027ve published a blogpost about the competition and the module to the Planet Drupal (an RSS feed for the Drupal community). We will be following up with another post about the demo video (also here attached). We\u0027ll do another video that is targeted at site builders. We would like to talk with the Context.IO team about community outreach programs in the Drupal community We want to still implement attachment handling We want to set up a beta invite signup page to check for interest for the prototype that we built. We believe there might be interest for it as a customisable B2B solution. Maildispenser demo implementation Selectively share email Maildispenser is an application that helps people selectively share emails. With it you can set up filters that will automatically upload emails into an online archive space. Each archive space can be shared with a group of people of your choice. With it, you no longer need to forward your emails or give access to your mailbox. Access permissions are granular: other people only get to see the emails they need, and when they no longer need access you can revoke their permissions. Unlike the native gmail filters that will only forward when they arrive to your inbox, Maildispenser can also help you share old emails. Invoice sharing Earlier this year my assistant who helps me processing my expenses went on pregnancy leave. In the past years I had set up a large number of email filters in Gmail that forwarded invoices to her, now I not only had to redo those filters, I also had to forward a number of invoices that hadn’t been processed yet. If you work with one assistant this is a bit of a hassle, if you work with a number of different people from odesk for example, this can be enough hassle to undue whatever time savings you made using an admin in the first place. You could maybe solve the problem if you forward these mails to a separate mailbox, but then you have to keep changing your credentials for it. With Maildispenser, you can set up a space for your invoices, you can either define a catch all filter, that will upload any email that mentions the word invoice. Or you could define individual filters that only upload emails that originate from a certain address and have a specific type of title, to upload invoices from each of your vendors separately. Once the system is set up you can then give your assistant access to your invoice space. When they are finished with the job, you can revoke their permissions. Email archive A few months ago we fell out with a customer, as a pre-seed startup they had run out of money. They threatened us with a law suit and played other tricks to try to make us do more and more work for ever shrinking amounts of money. When we didn’t give in, they deleted our sprintlogs and kicked us out of their ticketing system so that we wouldn’t have proof of the work we did for them. Luckily we had kept the notifications we got from their ticketing system. Email threads spread over a few different inboxes, however, are not all that great when you need to piece together what happened in a project. With Maildispenser you could in this case reconstruct the comments history from the ticketing system. You can set up a space and add emails from all the developers that worked on the project. With a special field that extracts the ticket number from the email title, you could add the comments in chronological order to the right ticket. Who we are Pronovix is a consultancy that supports developer-focused software companies: We integrate APIs from SaaS services like Context.IO, Livefyre, Gitlab and Brightcove with open source software (primarily Drupal) to make it even easier for developers to use those services. We provide maintenance and community support for the integrations. We help promote the integration in the developer community through blogposts and community specific outreach programs that play nice with the community and that are built on top of sometimes less obvious communication channels. We build websites for these companies that integrate documentation into their marketing site. This increases their search ranking, reduces support costs and improves ROI on sales.

Story One day in 2015, a student fell asleep during the class. Once she opened her eyes, the surrounding was different than before. Apparently her soul was trapped in another dimension of life, back in 1993 where the school became haunted because of a massive killing happened when one of the teacher became a psychopath who murdered students. The ghost of the psychopath teacher is now back and haunts her. She needs to find a way out of her dream to escape from death. In order to cast away the ghost, she must not make any noise and keep the school remain silent. Follow the sign and fulfill all objectives, racing with time silently. VR Gameplay Silence utilizes several elements for the input to create an immersive experience, includes head tracking movement and voice detection in the gameplay. To save your life you need to complete the mission by finding several sources of sound sequentially with a time limit for each of it. The longer you try to complete the mission, the closer the ghost to you. Control Gear VR is required to navigate the direction of surrounding. Gamepad button is required to move towards the direction, control the flashlight, increase focus hearing and take actions. Headphone is required to identify the source of the noise. Microphone (optional) will be used to process the player\u0027s audio to be adapted into the game. VR Innovation The main objective of Silence is to present the immersive experience of horror life for player. Therefore, Silence is focus on the display optimization supported with the in-game audio and player’s audio input to escalate the terror. Head-tracking sensor is used on the development to navigate the game, combining with the gamepad for easy-use navigation. In addition, we apply the audio sensor to catch player’s voice as an audio input, which will affect the gameplay.

What it does We have Cellular Automaton that simulate traffic situation in Hsuehshan tunnel and compute a recommended speed for app users to follow so that the random braking act are reduced. By following the recommended speed, the ETC toll fees will also be deducted by a discount rate to encourage users to drive faster through the tunnel.

Max capacity for cars to go through Hsueshan Tunnel is 2,400/hr and the average weekend car flow is 71,000 cars. There have been a wide range of discussions on how to tackle the issues from providing instant monitoring to leveraging the public transportation to reduce the total car flow. Are there any other options we can leverage to reduce some pains and time spent waiting on the road? Are there more efficient ways of managing the total car flow and optimizing the experiences of passengers in various purposes? What it does We think the root cause of this problem is the distance between cars is too long. While research shows that auto-pilotted cars can be used to reduce safety concerns when driving in an increased speed. Before we really have an auto-pilotted eCar system in place, GoforCar team focuses on utilizing the current technology to provide the best integrated option and relieving the traffic jam during the peak hour. To encourage people to use eCar, there is BUS \u0026 eCar ONLY LANE during peak hour to ensure that you can make it within 70 minutes from Yilan to Taipei or Taipei to Yilan. How I built it GoforCar team provides you the easiest way to rent a car from Taipei to Yilan. There are hundreds of eCar stations in Yilan County so that you can get on a eCar in 5 minutes with the “Reserve eCar” function. We use QR code to rent, verify and return the eCar to simplify the whole process. By using “Carpool” function, you can share your eCar with others to save your rental. Besides, to avoid high-occupancy vehicle lane policy in peak hour, the “Carpool” is another alternative for drivers to choose. Challenges I ran into Before getting the eCar solution, there are lots of great ideas during discussion. The thing is how to narrow down the scope and figure out which is the best. While research shows that auto-pilotted cars can be used to reduce safety concerns when driving in an increased speed. Before we really have an auto-pilotted eCar system in place, GoforCar team focuses on utilizing the current technology to provide the best integrated option and relieving the traffic jam during the peak hour. Besides, the other challenge we have met is how to simplify the process in reserving an eCar and carpooling with others. \"GoforCar\" team member came up with QR code from various solutions to make sure users only have to provide few information to get their eCar easily. Accomplishments that I\u0027m proud of Leverage the most current information technology to reach the goals of maximizing car flow and removing the bottleneck of total capacity allowance. We did an Efficiency Assessment showing there’s 27.48% improvement on the car flow if passengers on regular cars switch to eCar solution and go on carpool lane(eCar and bus only) with the buses. What I learned GoforCar team work together to discuss the project scope in the early beginning, every member contribute their creativity and capability to make this project happen. With the same belief to bring eCar to resolve the Hsuehshan tunnel issues, GoforCar is definitely the best team! What\u0027s next for GoforCar We are going to partner with other transportation and carpooling services such as Uber and Tripda to expand our eCar services.

Notes: Ideally, please wear headphones to appreciate the spatialized audio effects, and play for one turn after a tank is destroyed for reasons which will become clear once you do so. The first game of its type in virtual reality, in Scorched Battalion players take turns launching projectiles at their opponent on a randomly-generated, destructible map. In this case, the player is seated at a wargaming table directing toy-sized tanks on a miniature landscape, and switches to viewing the battlefield from a tank\u0027s perspective to aim shots. The game features unique and memorable characters voiced by actors including Richard Newman, creating a strong connection with the player. On the gameplay side, innovations include controlling more than one tank per player with simultaneous turns. Two shots are queued by each player and then fired in A,B,B,A order, increasing the importance of anticipating your opponent\u0027s moves and pre-empting them. On the VR side, the game features a mouse-like selection/cursor system which is more comfortable and natural to use than standard gaze crosshairs. A floating hat acts as an avatar, showing the movements of your opponent\u0027s head, providing a low-resource-usage, low-bandwidth way to represent a multiplayer opponent on a mobile device. The system would be ideally suited to cross-platform multiplayer, and could even be used to represent non-VR players. All menus and UI are represented in-world, including a clipboard with pages falling away to reveal new menus. A floating pencil is used as a cursor, providing a natural and efficient way for players to control the game while remaining fully immersed in the virtual world. A poster in the background provides dynamic text hints to the player, and audio spatialization is used to attract attention towards important events. Our main goals have been: To create a deep, highly-replayable strategy game that can be controlled easily and intuitively with only gaze control, the Gear VR touchpad, and (optionally) the back button. I feel confident that this has been achieved, though in a bite-sized chunk to make judging easier. We\u0027d like to expand the game into a full product in the future. To create an experience that can be enjoyed for long periods of time by users sensitive to simulator sickness, and without device overheating. This has been confirmed through extensive testing. To surprise players with events that would not be possible in a traditional game, abruptly altering gameplay in unexpected ways. I\u0027d prefer people to discover these surprises for themselves, but they\u0027re included in the video and described below for judging purposes. Additionally, watching tiny tanks do battle amongst miniature hills and valleys is appealing in itself, and VR allows players to understand space and distances in a way that would be impossible in a monitor-based 3D artillery game. MAJOR SPOILERS: Please do not read further if you already plan on playing the game. After a period of turn-based artillery combat, in-game characters attract the player\u0027s attention to something unusual above them. Once the player looks up, a large spider falls from the ceiling and enters the playfield. The game temporarily becomes an action game, with the opposing tank teams united against the bizarre new threat. Movement is controlled by the player\u0027s gaze, and shots are fired by tapping the touchpad. Later, when the spider is weakened, your perspective changes to a first person view where you aim and fire shots at the spider directly. One final, non-interactive surprise is left for the game.

Using some simple trig we are able to deduce the size of real life object using nothing but the data from the camera and computation. How it works With only a picture and some information about the camera and lens, we are able to calculate the approximate real height and width of an object in focus. Simply point the camera at an object, tap to focus, and drag a crop box around the object of interest to get the real size of that object, in meters. The math is derived from lens formulae and some simple trigonometry. Challenges I ran into Every camera is different, and almost every variable is non-linear. This makes creating solutions difficult.

{"likes":20,"hackathon":"AT\u0026T NYU Connect Ability Challenge","winner":false,"name":"Pallette","blurp":"A tongue-controlled wireless device empowering interaction with the world around you","description":"Introducing Pallette - The Tongue Interface We envision a tongue interface capable of controlling technology to enable more independent living. Currently quadriplegics do not have a mobile, discreet method of finely controlling the technology used in their daily lives. The tongue is one of the most sensitive and versatile muscles in the body, it is also concealed within the mouth. Though previous attempts of using the tongue as an interface for technology exist, none of them have succeeded in achieving a comfortable and lasting experience for the users while enabling control of multiple technologies. Specifically for our project we have created Pallette, a tongue-controlled wireless device that fits in the mouth of the user and connects to a mobile phone through an app that we have developed. This app will act as hub to which other devices can connect to via bluetooth, allowing the user to select which device to control via Pallette. The current version of Pallette has been designed behind the idea of a computer mouse: a trackpoint which allows navigation and direction and 2 buttons that can be clicked to indicate commands. It can then be connected to any device compatible with Blueetooth technology through the mobile app. These devices will each have their own configuration as to how to interpret the signals from the trackpoint and buttons in order to perform different actions. By achieving a strong tongue interface we can extrapolate control to multiple devices including motorized wheelchair control, video games, thermostats, lighting, and so much more. Specifically, the increased interconnectivity expected to take place with the smart homes of the future and the trend of Internet of Things will bring about more connectivity between physical and digital world. Pallette taps into this and provides quadriplegics with access to all of these devices. Although the possibilities of Pallette are endless, we want to submit it to the mobility solutions category. Please take a look at our website: http://web.pallette.us Our proposed solution Wireless prototype and mobile app We have developed a functioning prototype that showcases our vision for what Pallette can be: At its core, it is made of an Arduino Blend Micro board which sends bluetooth signals based on button clicks or joystick movement to the mobile app. The board, buttons and joystick have been assembled together and encapsulated in a 3D printed cover that provides the form of the device. It has been designed taking comfort and long term use into account. The mobile app which Pallette connects to acts as hub for many different devices to interface with it. The only requirement is for them to have Bluetooth access and to be configured to interpret the signals from the app. The total cost of creating the current Pallette prototype was less than $50. The new Pallette! The new mobile app! Previous version from AT\u0026T and NYU Connect Ability Hackathon We originally developed an initial, functioning wired protoype that was developed and presented during AT\u0026T and NYU Connect Ability Hackathon: This prototype possessed the functions of a mouse, except that instead of operating it with hands and limbs it sat on the roof of the mouth and was operated with the tongue. The design incorporated different elements: Two clickable buttons which were mounted as large-area buttons on the left and right sides of the interface. The size and texture of the button clicks were made tactile through lever motion of plastic and wide button caps. A pressure-sensitive trackpoint nub which was mounted in between the buttons. This pressure sensitive nub could be pushed in all directions with a continuous spectrum of movement spanning a 2-D plane. (For reference, this “trackpoint nub” is the same as the red blip mouse found on most IBM thinkpad laptops). This nub controls a mouse cursor. The trackpoint tip is concave, enabling the tip of the tongue to grip and better direct the cursor. A mouthguard to hold everything together and fit inside the mouth of the user. Improvements made from previous version While everyone thought the idea had enormous potential and the prototype was impressive, we received important feedback which we have been working on to make the idea even better: Our project lacked a strong software component. Since then, we developed a mobile app from the ground up with which Pallette connects in order to send different signals to other devices. As explained in the previous section, other devices will connect to the app to receive the signals from Pallette and perform corresponding actions. Secondly, as seen in the pictures, this initial prototype was wired. This implies certain limitations for the user, including comfort and ability to speak. Because of this, we made Pallette a wireless device which connects to the mobile app via Bluetooth, allowing the user to completely close his mouth with the device discreetly inside. This brings us to our third improvement: the design of form. In order to make Pallette a device that can be used extensively throughout the day, it has to be comfortable enough and allow the user to speak without much effort. To achieve this, we have completely redesigned the idea of the mouthguard, which is no longer necessary. As of now the attachment scheme is to use dental floss to weave between the middle to back teeth to hold the device in place and enable smiling. It would take a bit more effort to get on, and the loop sizing would have to be adjusted to fit the person\u0027s mouth, but easier than getting custom retainers and reduces the bulk. What\u0027s next? Although we have made incredible progress in very little time, there is still a lot of work ahead. Our next step for the short-term future is designing and implementing Pallette\u0027s API. With the Pallette API the developer community can incorporate Pallette interaction into their software and hardware. Making their devices and applications Pallette compatible means making them quadriplegic accessible! Developing Pallette\u0027s API for universal access After finishing the final touches of the Pallette device and app, we will begin the development of Pallette\u0027s API. Through this API, any device with Bluetooth technology will be able to connect to the mobile app, and therefore, Pallette. All these devices will need are ways to interpret the signal from Pallette and decide what action to execute. Our initial idea is to connect Pallette to a wheelchair via Bluetooth and allow the user to move it with his Tongue. After this, we will consider many other possibilities to help make the lives of quadriplegics more independent. Design Process The results achieved so far wouldn\u0027t have been possible without the extensive iteration process, user feedback gathering, and protype testing we have followed since the begnning of the project in January. Information Gathering and User Interviews In the first place we wanted to understand quadriplegia and the problems it creates in day to day tasks. Therefore we did extensive reasearch of quadripelgia at great scale to get the big picture of the problem. However, this kind of research did not help us understand what it really felt like to be a quadriplegic. We then understood that user interviews were absolutely necessary. One of the early challenges of our proposed project is the fact that finding people with spinal cord injury to interview is not easy. We explored multiple channels for interviews: longer term medical channels through professors with an interest in medical technology, and more immediate channels though the Christopher Reeves Foundation and its community. We spoke with a representative of the Christopher Reeves Foundation who was very helpful in finding people to interview. She provided us with a list of different communities we could reach out to, including their own forum, a SCI patients email list, and other online sites. After contacting members of these communities we received wonderful feedback that helped shape what Pallette has become. Please find detailed interview information on the User Feedback Forms provided separately. Sketching the initial solution We came up with 3 different sketches of what our final result could be based on, taking into account the insight provided by the people we interviewed. Sketch 1 - Joystick / Ball pad with buttons The idea in this case is using a mouth mold that can be inserted and removed easily from the person’s mouth, allowing the user to use the joystick to select different options: Sketch 2 - Touch pad with buttons Our second idea was the use of a trackpad instead of a joystick, with different buttons depending on the location of the pleader the user decides to touch. Sketch 3 - EMG Interface In this case we pivoted a little from the original tongue interface, using EMG technology to sense the muscles near the throat based on tongue movement. This way, depending on the muscle that is moved, different actions can be performed. This would allow the user to be able to eat while wearing the device, and allows for a simple, nice looking design. Heuristic Evaluation with Low-Fi Prototypes To prototype our tongue-controlled interface, we created two sets of prototypes; one set to asses the haptic function of button pressing using a modified calculator, and another to asses the form of the interface inside the mouth. Both prototype sets were meant to rest against the top of the mouth and interfaced by the tongue from below. We iterated different times over these protoypes based on feedback from users (detailed below). Prototype 1 - Calculator A cheap $4 calculator was used to test the ability of users to perform operations with their tongue. The idea behind it was to ask users to press different buttons and see based on the results of the scree if their input was correct. This would give us an idea of how easy it is to control a button set inside the mouth. Version 1 was constructed from a full portable calculator. The prototype was wrapped in plastic, with the button portion being placed in the person’s mouth. The designer asked the person to press certain buttons or perform certain operations and the person attempted to do so. Participants complained about the large size; some people could barely fit the keypad into their mouth. Furthermore while the buttons were easy to push by hand, they were difficult to push by the tongue. Buttons towards the back of the keypad were hardest to push, as participants found it difficult to reach towards the back of their mouth. Buttons were easiest to press in immediate circumference around the center of the keypad. Version 2 attempted to address these concerns by reducing the size of the keypad and reducing tactile load required to press the buttons. The the keypad was folded and clamped with tape, and the buttons were replaced with conductive metal slats. These slats enabled a button press with a gentle tap of the tongue. Prototype 2 - Polyester Forms The stuffs prototypes were used to address the sensation of a user having something in his mouth designed to be used for longer periods of time. This would give us an initial impression of what it might feel like to use our tongue- interface technology. It also gave us, the designers, an impression of how complicated it might be to fit the buttons to be handled by the user within the constraints of the shape of the mouth without being uncomfortable. Version 1 attempted to create a thin, less defined form as a staring base to understand how big we could make the form within the confines of the mouth. This first guess proved to be too big to reasonably fit in the mouth. When used it looked like a blue tongue sticking out of the mouth. Version 2 reduced the size and profile of version 1 according to one of our participants feelings on sizing. After an initial trial, the form was curved to better fit the curvature of the mouth. This form fit with adequate space, and the participant felt like they were able to comfortably reach the majority of exposed real estate. The two most prominent complaints were: The prototype was not attached to the top of the mouth and would sometimes float around It did not include an identifiable buttons and therefore left the interface mapping up to the imagination. Using the form factor of version 2, version 3 was created with a button and control layout. Participants agreed that buttons were then recognizable by the tongue quite well despite their small size, and that some of this interface should be streamlined with less number of elements and more distinct elements to individual touch. Med-Fi Prototype Based on the users’ feedback during the previous prototype versions, we kept testing different materials to get a better understanding of what might be comfortable for the user. In that sense, we tried materials that varied from chocolate and cheese to plastic and foam. This helped us understand different textures that might be familiar for the user when using our product. We then proceeded to address the problem of operating with our previous prototype that used a calculator screen to indicate success of operations. This time around we built a more robust prototype that: Had a shape that allowed for easy insertion in the mouth. Was able to perform the operations of turning lights on and off with 2 different buttons. The tools used for building our prototype consisted of: An Arduino board (to make all the connections to the buttons and the lights and program it so that on a button push the lights would turn on) LED Lights Pushable buttons (that would activate the LED lights) Plastic which would cover the buttons and work as our form to be put inside the mouth The shape of the plastic cover was modified through heat. Tape was sued to keep everything together, cables were used to connect the buttons to LEDs, and plastic bags were used to allow for multiple uses of our prototypes by different people. Previous versions of the material used in our prototype included stuffs, which were helpful to address what the shape of the device should be, but the feeling was not very much liked during the heuristic evaluation. Because of this, we decided to then go with plastic, which has so far been very successful. Hi-Fi Prototype After the previous iterations, we finally got to our Hi-Fi prototype. This prototype acts as an interface as in the form of mouse to a computer and is encased in a vacuum formed housing that sits in the concave dome behind the teeth of the upper jaw. Mouse interfacing was achieved through the rewiring of mouse components. The interface is exposed to the tongue as two buttons - “Left” and “Right”. These two buttons take up the entirety of the exposed interface to aid in control by the tongue. With this prototype we seeked to test users’ control and comfort through a sequence of computer interfacing tasks. In designing a tongue interface we wanted to make sure that the device comfortably fits in the user’s mouth and the users have fine enough control to achieve their desired tasks without frustration. User tests We then proceeded to test the protoype in the real world based on 3 tasks of varying motor difficulty users would need to perform. The first simple task consisted of giving a screen which randomly indicates what button to press and the user pressing those buttons. A counter of the right and wrong inputs is then recorded. This task allowed to test comfort and control. The second moderate task consisted of giving a users a pdf document of several pages long, and having them scroll up and down by clicking on the buttons. The rationale behind this task was to gain a qualitative impression of the feeling of the device in a common task users al already used to doing in another way. The scrolling of documents was very simple for us to do, since all that was need was to map the up and down arrow keys to the left and right clicks. After performing the task, users were asked for a general impression of the task, if they found any difficulties, if they felt in control all the time, and if they had any other feedback to provide. The third complex task consisted of the user playing a video game using only the tongue-interface. The rationale behind this task was to gain a better understanding of the amount of control a user can have when using the tongue interface in complex, dynamic environments. Because of this, users were asked to play a simple video game which only required them to click every time they wanted a block to jump and evade obstacles. We measure the score of the game session as the quantitive variable. Users were asked to play the video game 3 times, and the highest and lowest scores were recorded. After running the tasks with the different participants of our study, we arrived to the conclusion that the tasks performed were all quite simple for users to do. This gave us great insight into understanding what we were doing right and wrong. Please look at the User Feedback Form for more details about the tests. Based on the results received, we were then ready to take our prototype to the next level by incorporating a joystick-like functionality in order to actually be able to move the mouse around. This would give us an even better impression of the tasks that the final users were expected to perform. Moreover, the use of plastic bags to cover the prototype was well- received among users, meaning that in future scenarios we would continue using it. Fully functioning prototype for AT\u0026T and NYU Connect Ability Hackathon After all the lessons learned, we decided it was time to incorporate the mouse controlling functionality into our device. Based on the feedback we received from the previous high fidelity prototype we added the trackpoint for more fine control and incorporated all elements into a fixed mouthguard retainer. This addressed two major concerns of not having the device fixed in place and not being able to discern the left and right side. The presence of the trackpoint further provides subtle intuition of the divide from left to right. Additionally, the tactile feel of the buttons significantly improved over past versions; the new version incorporated the mechanics of a keyboard in order to increase the accuracy of button presses. Finally we designed the wire coming out the side of the apparatus and bundled it in a thin beige tube to be more subtle. In order to do add the trackpoint, we used ripped out several old IBM laptops to take the trackpoint from their keyboards. These trackpoints were attached to small boards that allowed us to connect the trackpoint to an Arduino Micro. After being able to move the cursor of the mouse with the TrackPoint connected to the Arduino and adding 2 buttons that would act as a left and right click, it was time incorporate it into the device. In order to do this, we bought a $13 mouthguard that would help fit the device into the mouth and built a small form to house the trackpoint and the buttons. It is worth noting that to determine the right size of the device, we used a mouth mold. The last step consisted on adding plastic covers to the device buttons, and it was ready go! This final prototype possesses the functions of a mouse, except that instead of operating it with hands and limbs it sits on the roof of the mouth and is operated with the tongue. The design incorporates three elements. Two clickable buttons are mounted as large-area buttons on the left and right sides of the interface, and a pressure-sensitive trackpoint nub is mounted in between. The pressure sensitive nub can be pushed in all directions with a continuous spectrum of movement spanning a 2-D plane. (For reference, this “trackpoint nub” is the same as the red blip mouse found on most IBM thinkpad laptops). This nub controls a mouse cursor. The size and texture of the button clicks have been made tactile through lever motion of plastic and wide button caps. The trackpoint tip is concave, enabling the tip of the tongue to grip and better direct the cursor. We also incorporated trackpoint sensitivity sensitivity within the source code allowing us to easily increase or decrease the sensitivity as desired. In fact, we can even scale sensitivity for a specific axis, X or Y. We found this helped greatly given the strength and precision of a tongue differs from person to person. Also the agility of the tongue is different from left to right contrasted with front to back. Building a wireless version of Pallette We finally got to the point in which we were confident enough about our design to take it to the next level. Sketching Pallette 2.0 Based on the feedback received during the AT\u0026T and NYU Connect Ability Hackathon, we knew that comfort had to be a first priority. Because of this, we sketched a new version of the form and decided to move away from the idea of using a mouthguard to hold everything together, and opted for using dental floss attached to the improved form for fitting the device into the user\u0027s mouth. Using Arduino Blend Micro to make it wireless We also understood how important it was to make the device wireless. In order to do this, we purchased an Arduino Blend Micro board which comes with a Bluetooth transmiter to send the signals from the buttons and joystick. We connected everything together and made sure the Bluetooth signal was working. Developing the mobile app Before printing the 3D model of the device and assembing everything together, we developed a rough version of the mobile app which will act as a hub for other devices to interact with Pallette. The idea is very simple: the user connects Pallette and all the devices he wishes to control to the mobile app. He then selects what device to control with the app pre-detemrined tongue gestures (this is a work in progress) or by tapping on the screen. The app shows the device selected and the actions it has available. When the user taps a button or moves the joystick in his Pallette device, the corresponding action is executed by the active device. For now, the app does not connect to any external devices, but that is the next step! After getting the UI right, we designed the colors and different default actions we would like to propose the user. In future versions of the app, users will be able to customize the devices they wish to interact with.  Updating 3D sketch We then decided to go for the colors presented, and updated our 3D sketch to match it. Assembling everything together We printed an initial version of the form we wanted to use, and although adjustments will have to be made, for the purpose of testing and as a first functioning wireless prototype it was more than enough. The beauty of 3D printing is that we can always adjust for that and even customize based on each person’s mouth. We proceeded to assemble everything together: Finally, Introducing Pallette 2.0! While the size was larger than we expected (it still fits in a person\u0027s mouth), we now need to reduce it and add dental floss to hold it inside the mouth and run further tests. That, combined with our idea of a universal interface, are the next steps.

Every hour, someone in the UK is diagnosed with Parkinson\u0027s disease, showing just how large the scale of the problem I\u0027m trying to treat is. The inspiration behind Free Feet came from when I was discussing treatments for Parkinson\u0027s patients, at the kitchen table, with my brother, who is a movement disorders (Parkinson\u0027s) nurse. He said that there weren\u0027t many treatments available for gait freezing, so I decided to see what I could do to help. This is where the idea of Free Feet was born. I also have an emotional connection to Parkinson\u0027s as I have a neighbour who sufferers from the illness, so I knew the impact that both gait freezing, and Parkinson\u0027s can have on quality of life. This really inspired me to pursue and develop my idea, as there is no known cure for Parkinson\u0027s, finding new ways of treating it is really important. How it works Free Feet treats gait freezing in Parkinson\u0027s Disease. It is a laser device attached to the side of a shoe which is designed to help reduce gait freezing for Parkinson\u0027s sufferers. Gait freezing is a very common symptom which affects approximately 72% of people with Parkinson\u0027s, it is a shuffling movement in the legs and feet. The laser places a red dot on the ground in front of the user. This then changes the users walking from being automatic to non-automatic. This is really important, as in Parkinson\u0027s, there is a deficiency in the neurotransmitter (chemical) dopamine. Dopamine is responsible for movement and muscular action, so when there\u0027s a deficiency in dopamine, reduced mobility also occurs. However, the midbrain is more severely affected than the frontal lobes. Free Feet works by enabling the user to change their walking from being automatic to non-automatic, when they focus on the dot. This is really important, as it means that the user employs the frontal lobes instead of the midbrain, meaning there is more dopamine available to them, and therefore more ability for movement to occur, thus decreasing the severity of the gait freezing episode. Small scale clinical trials, which we have carried out in collaboration with the Galway Parkinson\u0027s Association have shown very positive results, with an approximate decrease in freezing severity of 40%. Challenges I ran into I have faced many challenges in the development of Free Feet, as being a young woman in STEM, I have always been in the minority of my peer group. I have faced the challenge of overcoming the barrier of youth, as in professional situations, such as networking events, it is hard to ensure that you and your ideas are taken seriously and that your work is appreciated for its full value. An example of this I like to share is a networking event which I attended recently, and because of my age, I was asked if I was looking for one of my parents. I thought that this was certainly a situation in which I was not being taken seriously, and overcame that challenge by explaining my presence and work. I have also faced the challenge of balancing my work and school life, whilst working on the development of Free Feet, I have completed the A-Level equivalent exams (Irish Leaving Certificate) and earned my first choice course in University (Biotechnology). I thought that this was quite a challenge, as I had to balance my time and resources very carefully, but it worked out for the better in the end! I also faced the challenge of learning the technical skills necessary to build the prototype of the device. Free Feet is a device which I built myself, at my kitchen table. In order to do this I needed to learn electronics, soldering and stitching skills, and they were quite the challenge to master! Accomplishments that I\u0027m proud of I\u0027m very proud that I have successfully trialled a medical device which I created at my kitchen table, and have found that it could help reduce the severity of gait freezing by such a vast percentage. I\u0027m really proud, that against the odds, and people telling me that it would not be possible, I\u0027ve kept making progress with the commercialisation of my device. I\u0027m very proud that I have recieved the backing of my national medical device association, the IMDA, and that they believed in me and my abilities enough to invest in my personal development. I\u0027m also really proud that developing my device now means, that I have, at my fingertips, the potential to help millions of people around the world suffering from Parkinson\u0027s disease. I think that it is really fantastic to be able to reach out and help others through technology, and I\u0027m immensely proud of what I have achieved thus far. I\u0027m really proud of getting into the outbox incubator, its something that I never thought would have been possible for me to achieve, and I\u0027m just delighted. I was really proud to get the opportunity to present Free Feet to our national minister for health, and to learn that he was very impressed with it was fantastic, he said that he hopes to see it in use in the very near future. What I learned I learnt a lot about how a company works and how to properly forecast financial expenditure. I also learnt more about brand image and how to appropriatly convert that to the consumer. This has led to me being much more conscious regards the logo aand web presence of the business. What\u0027s next for Free Feet Free Feet now needs funds in order to be able to reach its full potential. This involves raising finance in order to cover the day to day running costs of the business in the immediate future, as well as funds to cover the cost of a clinical trial and product R\u0026D.

At the same time the loveria between a developer and his macbook has become so strong that he does not have enough time to socialize with feeble creatures like humans.

Categories help them narrow down the purpose of the hint and allow others to easily search the map for relevant discussions. Challenges I ran into Using Shareabouts, Wilson and I have discovered the woes of hacking into a platform that uses many levels of abstraction: Django, Handlebars, Backbone, Postgres, Postgis, etc etc...

Introduction Addicaid addresses the unmet need for the specific community of individuals struggling with substance and process disorders as well as the friends and families who love them. There\u0027s over 30 million cases of addiction in the US and the UK. Globally, over 200 million people consume some form of illicit drugs. Despite a dismal success rate, there are few technology-based solutions that form communities and provide the peer support that is essential in managing substance and processes disorders. It is a fatal epidemic, and we need to do better. As active addiction grows more serious, its social impact expands exponentially in a multitude of ways. Why Communities Need Addicaid To help strengthen communities in the long run, we need to strengthen the lives of the underserved. Why should we care about substance abuse? Because whether we like it or not, we’re all eventually affected in one way or another by drug and alcohol addiction. It might be a close relative or friend, a neighbor or co-worker or someone you haven’t met yet, but sooner or later substance abuse will touch our lives. Drug abuse is a problem that involves communities as much as it does individual users. We owe it to our communities to create a solution. Addiction has a massively destructive impact on society. Substance abuse is a major contributing factor to societal problems that weaken communities and exacerbate daily life such as crime, poverty and homelessness, healthcare costs, unemployment and student dropout rates. It is a destructive staple of virtually every community and is getting worse year after year. While our target user base is those who have addiction disorders and their loved ones, Addicaid positively impacts entire communities with its potential to reduce crime, poverty, healthcare costs, and unemployment. Those who become addicted to alcohol or drugs could be productive members of society. Many of those who do manage to get sober go on to live highly productive lives; some even become pillars of the community. Addicts who never manage to escape their addiction are a loss for society and their potential is wasted. How ObjectRocket is Helping Addicaid Help Communities We are using ObjectRocket for MongoDB as our database to store everything- support group meeting listings, user details and activity, chatrooms, private messages, and feed content. Addicaid has many different data collections so the individual management was perfectly suited for our needs. With ObjectRocket for MongoDB, it was unbelievably easy to setup a feature-rich, high-performance product that is secure and stable. We are excited to explore all the other features ObjectRocket has to offer. Specific Community Research As a native New Yorker, I looked at how addiction impacts my hometown and was devastated to see the magnitude of its negative effects on our general population. Its influence is multifaceted, and it\u0027s getting worse. But these statistics are similar, and even worse, in other states. Nationwide, over 50% of crimes are committed under the influence and 600,000 people are dying annually. When we look at these metrics, it becomes clear that we need to address this problem head-on if really want to make things better. The Solution By creating an integrated system with an international support network that helps more people enter recovery and stay in recovery, we can advance opportunities for the underserved, increase upward mobility, and give affected parents the encouragement they need to be amazing role models. It’s very difficult for people to admit they are suffering from addiction and once they do, it’s even harder to identify the causes and what approach will be most effective. We cater to all degrees of the addiction spectrum, different vices, process addictions, and emotional disabilities of the families and friends of people struggling with the disease. The option to remain anonymous allows people to more comfortably enter our community. How Addicaid Works Features Daily check-ins Users check in daily with urge to use, if they relapsed, and can write any extra details. This helps them track their progress and overtime see trends in their recovery. SOS Alerts When someone has a burning desire, they can send out an SOS Alert to the community. Members can see the SOS Alerts in the main feed and reach out to those in immediate need of support. This is an easier, low-impact way to ask for help than reaching out to the community. Chatrooms Whenever a member wants to engage in a general discussion, they can enter chatrooms of different topics to suit their recovery goals. It is especially helpful for people who want to connect with others but either do not have in-person meetings available to them or simply prefer a digital alternative. Private messaging For more personal conversations, there\u0027s private messaging to help enhance relationships between members. Friend finder A major current challenge is finding like-minded people in recovery. Addicaid makes it easy by supplying filters for relevant details such as type of addiction, recovery time, location, and general demographics. Meeting directory We have the most comprehensive meeting directory thanks to our custom data scraper that collects hundreds of thousands of meetings from over 20 different kinds of self-help groups. What’s unique about our meeting directory aside from its accuracy and comprehensiveness is the meeting feedback loop. It helps users connect to others who attend the same meetings and tag and comment the meeting with relevant information to help make meetings more transparent. Users can join, favorite and add their meetings to their calendar to make sure they never miss a meeting. Journaling Addicaid provides an easy way to share struggles and successes with our journaling functionality. Users can share via text, audio recordings, and imagery. Members can comment or like other member\u0027s activity to provide ongoing encouragement and suggestions. Recovery Goals Our unique goal response system allows members to write and or record responses which helps those who may have issues writing down their thoughts. We create goals based on CBT(cognitive behavioral therapy) which is proven to be effective in resetting the stubborn, destructive patterns of addiction. Target Users Our target user base consists of recovery veterans in the 12-step program who want a low-impact way to give community encouragement and manage their disease in the long-run as well as newcomers who need a stigma-free introduction to recovery. Addicaid platform provides a low barrier of entry to by appealing to a wider population than the one-size-fits-all 12-step model because we understand that addiction is a spectrum disorder, not a “you have it or you don’t” disease. We already launched our MVP and our users are raving about it with superlatives. Plans for the Future Gain traction But in order to create a more engaged and supportive community, we need more users. After debugging this ObjectRocket version we plan on forging referral programs with treatment facilities and mental health professionals-- they will be our primary distribution outlets. Expand Our meeting database will continue to improve and grow to service a more diverse community and expand to the UK. Diversify Once we\u0027ve proven that our method works and have established an active, diverse community, we will begin introducing new products to help get more people into recovery and stay in recovery. My Story I started Addicaid because I needed something like it when I was in the throes of early recovery and had trouble forming meaningful connections with other 12-step meeting goers. I first began building a meeting directory with a feedback loop so people could be more informed about the type of meeting they are going to and connect with attendees on a digital platform.

PRESENTATION SteamCrew VR is a Steampunk themed, arcade cooperative submarine game focused on giving two players the highest immersion and a maximal amount of opportunities for real-time interactions. Our aim is to offer a strong sense of camaraderie between two physically present players, setting a new level in terms of game presence. Both must share their informations to pick up Steam Tanks, keeping the submarine afloat and powered. They need to sink guardians to collect their Gems. INSTRUCTIONS SteamCrew VR gets players to be treasure hunters Captain\u0027 Karkass and Ida Steele, crew of pirate steam submarine Rocketshrimp. Pilot\u0027s seat, is responsible for navigation, steam tanks positions are marked on the Gyro Ring. STEER the ship through gaze while HOLDING on the touchpad. SWIPE FORWARD to ACCELERATE. SWIPE BACKWARD to REVERSE, engine consume steam. Check the submarine\u0027s steam level and current consumption. Toggle LIGHTS on/off by TAPPING on the button. Turning it off saves steam. At the gunner\u0027s signal, TAP on handles to FIRE torpedoes or rocket. Gunners\u0027s seat, is responsible for observation. detects enemy positions by TAPPING on the Sonar\u0027s button. AIM and lead targets with the turret through gaze while HOLDING on the touchpad. Shoot the back of enemies to score Critical hits (x2 damage). SWIPE UPWARD to CLIMB. SWIPE DOWNWARD to DIVE. Check the submarine\u0027s steam level and current consumption. Use Gyro Ring ring to communicate enemy position to the Pilot. We did a QUICK TUTORIAL VIDEO on how to play the game for both players. DESIGN SteamCrew VR is an experiment on VR social interactions. By separating informations between players, we want to promote communication and cooperation. The game offers short gameplay sessions ranging from 3 to 10 minutes during which players would go through phases of exploration, survival, hunting and combat. Each player have asymmetrical and complementary roles that would still be equally interesting and engaging, with a small number of game rules. CONTROLS The game is played with the touchpad, it does not require gamepads. A unified control system and world representation ensures players feel aboard the same submarine in both roles. Gaze selection is the natural choice for command selection as it is a very immersive way to interact with objects around. INNOVATION Discussing during play enhances the feeling of presence; perceptions are reinforced by meaningful interactions in the same universe. Seeing each other moving and performing actions, enhances body awareness. Slow pacing of movement and multiple spatial references (cockpit, Gyro ring and floaters) prevent nausea. Instant coop gaming in VR without hassle in a streamlined game lobby. CHALLENGES We are two full time developers at Agharta Studio, SteamCrew VR is our first project on Unity so there was a learning curve. The game is built exclusively on new game assets that are exclusive to the jam, based on the concept art of our friends at Blackmuffin Studio. No store plugins were used to ensure total control on performances and tweaking. Working live multiplayer in such a short project was a very ambitious feature for us. We went through a constant refocus to keep the project feasible in 4 Weeks. Design and controls changed a lot from our initial aim, we switched from simulation to arcade to be more accessible to new players The physically based display system we had in mind proved far too complex to make. We decided to add HUD elements and feedback through icons, making events more readable and dynamic. EXPANSIONS Entire cockpit redesign allowing players to see each other better and more often.

Quick hand-over of kids to their parents at the end of school day","description":"Inspiration Every day in Mexico City a lot of traffic and contamination is generated when kids are leaving school; this is caused because in almost all the schools, they call the kids when their parents are a few steps from the school door, or right in front of it. This problems can be solved if the schools could prepare the kids and keep them near the exit door before their parents arrival. If every school starts using Pick@School, we would take care of our planet, reducing: contamination, traffic, delivery times, noise; having a better coexistance, and the possibility to have more time with our kids. What it does With Pick@School, in a modern and secure way; parents will notify the school they are on their way to pick their son; every day a new QR will be generated in the cel phone; the institution receives the notification in a Tablet or Ipad with the information of: wich kids is leaving, who is going to pick it up, type and color of the vehicle or walking and how far away from school they are. The application is constantly updated, and arrange the kids in the Tablet or Ipad screen, based on the proximity to the school of the person who will pick the child. This information allows the school to prepare the children and keep them near the exit door prior to the parents arrival. Parents no longer have to wait so long to pick up their children, with Pick@School child hand-over is faster because the school can prepare children´s before their parents arrival; rather than call them when their parents have already arrived. This is useful for people who pick their children by car or walking. The school only need one or more tablets or iPads to receive notifications and scan the codes of the parents cel phone. When scanning these codes, the school will generate a report containing information of the deliveries: child\u0027s name, who picked him up, at what time he left, what car or walking, and who delivered the child. Permissions can be given by parents to different people, they are called \"authorized\"; every user has an unique code; that code will allow parents to give permissions so the \"authorized\" can pick his kids from school (this can be used when the kids are invited to make homework, have lunch, a party or playing in a friends house) There´s one app for parents, one app for school (both of them available for IOS and Android); and the master control that is operated by the general administrator and school administrators in a computer. All the information is encrypted, besides the use of SSL certificate Accomplishments that I\u0027m proud of Right now one school is already using the app; a couple more are in a trial period it, and I´m talking with a couple more to start the trial period so they can test it.

{"likes":29,"hackathon":"Hsuehshan Tunnel Transformer","winner":false,"name":"BANANA viva Yilan","blurp":"provide better driving experience by an android app","description":"Inspiration For many Yilan residents, the easiest and the quickest way to travel to Taipei and other parts of Taiwan is via Freeway No.5 and through Hsuehshan Tunnel. But the huge demand for the four-lane highway has resulted in heavy congestion, especially on the weekends. For a quicker, safer way home for all Yilan people, we propose a different toll collection system based on the current traveling speeds on different segments of the highway, the slower the speed, the higher the toll rates, thus encouraging drivers to travel through alternative routes when the highway gets too crowded. When the speed on the highway falls below 30km/hr, we set up the toll rate to be as high as 12 times of the original! We believe this system can effectively reduce the amount of vehicles entering the highway whenever a congestion occurs, thus raising the overall travel speed on the highway. What it does We strive to come up with a solution that\u0027s not only feasible in theory, but also functions well in real life, so constructing an app for all android system users has always been our main goal in the project. After analyzing the traveler needs, we developed this solution app called \"UWay\". the The user can install UWay on their mobile phones and look for the traffic information of Freeway No.5 anywhere, anytime. Besides highway information, we also provide other traffic website links and traveling information of Yilan. The UWay app has six main functions: Road Condition Inquiry Here, the app shows the synchronized traveling speed of six segment on Freeway No.5. The exact speed in km/hr is provided, with corresponding traffic status \"smooth\", \"average\", \"congested\". Travel Time Estimation The traveling time in each of the six segments is provided. The user can add up the total travel time based on the sections he/she will travel by clicking on the \"checkbox\"s of each segment. Travel Cost Estimation This function pre-calculate the travel fees on the six segments of freeway NO.5 according to the traffic fluctuation. We set the base toll rate at 1.2NTD/km, and the rate varies with the travel speed. The different rates are shown in the following: Travel speed            Number of times of the original rate over 70km/hr            X1 60~70km/hr              X2 50~60km/hr              X3 40~50km/hr              X5 30~40km/hr              X7 below 30km/hr          X12 The system can also add up the total cost depending on the sections designated by on the user. Other Links This part of the app provides the links of other websites containing traffic information all over Taiwan. This may be very useful if the driver decides to take alternative routes to Yilan. Travel Information This link will direct the user to the Yilan official tourism website, providing local transit information and other upcoming tourist events. Incidents report This is a feedback function for travelers to instantly report back to the system on the current traffic status or road incidents. For further details please check out our demo video. How We built it We divide our team into two groups responsible for programming and promotion video editing/web page managing. The app: developed by MIT app inventor 2. Travel speed data: Government database. App icon, menu icons: created through Illustrator and Photoshop. Animation: created by Photoshop with timeline function. App demonstration: operated on an android phone. Post-production: Power Director 14. Challenges I ran into After we decide to reduce congestion traffic flow by raising the section toll rate, the first challenge we encountered is to determine the travel speed interval and the corresponding toll charge( how high should the charge get?). It took us a lot of discussion to finally set a 10km/hr interval and an increasing 2,3,5,7,12 times toll rates. Based on personal experiences, we all agree that the current toll fee is too low to force travelers to take different routes. A maximum 12 times of the original rate should be enough to compel most divers to take other roads. The second big problem is the data source. We encounter difficulties trying to directly download the instant speed data from the National Freeway Bureau website, so instead we focus on the downloadable Freeway No.5 traffic data of April, May June of this year(2015). We analyse the data provided by 157 cameras over the three month period first by removing the false/unreasonable data and then averaging the data during the same hour of every day, and finally locating the cameras closest to the current toll gates and use their data as reference speeds. Overall, it was a very time-consuming process due to the large amount of data. Accomplishments that I\u0027m proud of As a group as students, we\u0027re very proud of the fact that we created the \"UWay\" app all by ourselves! And although there are several downloadable apps providing freeway traffic information and toll fee calculation, we are the first to develop an app that combines the two major functions!!! What\u0027s next for Hsuehshan Tunnel Transformer Although we are very proud of what we\u0027ve done, there are still some possible improvements that can be worked on in the future: Find a way to directly use the immediate speed data in the current app to increase accuracy. Increase the functions of the app( future traffic prediction, alternate routes advise...). Thank you for your time and we hope you support our project~!!!

{"likes":18,"hackathon":"USDA Innovation Challenge","winner":false,"name":"Smart Crops","blurp":"Find the ideal crop based on irrigation cost and yield value by comparing and visualizing crop data and trends.","description":"Inspiration Water use has become a very important topic recently, especially in some of the western states right now that are experiencing drought. The Smart Crops app was created to enable users to visualize crop water needs and yield data. When a user adds input to factor in the cost of irrigation and the crops value this app can help identify an ideal crop. What it does This app provides two tools to aid people in finding an ideal crop. The \u0027Crop Selection Tool\u0027 allows users to pick a state and compare crops. After each crop choice the user enters the crop price. The crops average yield multiplied by this crop price will be used when determining the ideal crop at the end. When the crops have been selected the user then inputs their irrigation costs. This info will also be used when determining the ideal crop at the end. The \"Crop Detail Tool\u0027 allows user to visualize detailed crop data for a chosen state. Yield and water use data are plotted on a bar graph by year. The user can drill down into this data by clicking on a line in the graph to get all the details available for the crop. This includes the number of planted acres, irrigated acres, yield per acre, irrigation source (ground or surface), and amount of irrigation used. How I built it I am a big Android fan so I decided to build this as an Android application. The data set behind this app is supplied by the USDA in the ARMS - Irrigation and Technology Water Use report. Available @ http://innovationchallenge.azurewebsites.net/#ArmsTab Challenges I ran into Mostly just the typical Android development issues - targeting multiple devices/screen sizes, and dealing with the sometimes finicky Android Development Studio IDE. Accomplishments that I\u0027m proud of Food security is an important topic to me. The worlds population is growing quickly and those working in agriculture need to find new ways to use resources more efficiently and produce higher yields. I am proud to play a small part in aiding these endeavors by putting useful agricultural information into peoples hands. What I learned One of the most interesting things I found is the differences in how much water is used for irrigation for the same crop, but in separate states. Some states have very similar irrigation needs, but others vary wildly. For instance, on average California uses three times as much water to irrigate cotton than Texas. Wow! What\u0027s next for Smart Crops The example I gave about California\u0027s water use for cotton compared to Texas is not as easy to find as I\u0027d like. In the next update to this project I will build in features to allow users to easily compare crops between states.
